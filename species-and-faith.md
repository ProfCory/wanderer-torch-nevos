# Species & Society of Nevos

_"What separates them is history. What joins them is belief."_

---

## Dwarves
Governed by hearth-oaths and elder houses, dwarves reject monarchy. Their society runs on slow, deliberate consensus and stonebound law.

- **Power Structure**: Conclaves of elder houses
- **Values**: Memory, endurance, craftsmanship

---

## Elves
Elves choose leaders by memory and intuition, with elders who “remember how the wind moved when words were spoken.”

- **Variants**: Highborn, Woodland, Dusk-kin
- **Belief**: Time itself casts votes when silence is held

---

## Halflings
Ruled by open vote until age 120, halflings value lively debate and warm governance.

- **Traditions**: Public debate, advisory elders
- **Culture**: Festive, practical, tight-knit communities

---

## Gnomes
Gnomes are ruled by local respect or whim. Their society resembles a patchwork of tradition and genius-led consensus.

- **Structure**: Fluid leadership by local talent
- **Traits**: Innovative, chaotic-neutral leanings

---

## Humans & Orcs
Humans and orcs cohabitate, often in rivalry but mutual recognition. Humans prefer clever rulers; orcs follow wise matriarchs.

- **Humans**: Rule by charisma or cunning
- **Orcs**: All leadership is matriarchal
- **Shared Term**: “Cousins of the world”

---

## Nomadic Folk
Includes kobolds, goblins, and others. Rarely rooted, often excluded, but bear unique star-lore.

- **Traits**: Songkeepers, mobile enclaves
- **Faith**: Carried in charms, talismans, and old songs

## Touched
Tieflings and Aasimar are seen as star-marked—harbingers of change or divine attention.

- **Tieflings**: Flame-touched; often feared or respected
- **Aasimar**: Light-touched; revered or protected

---

## Celestials, Fiends, and Others
True names are forgotten; allegiance to stars or power defines them. Fey and fiends alike are bound by story and weight, not label.

- **Rulership**: Weight of story, not hierarchy
- **Realms**: Hells, Feywild, Shadows, Abyss, more

---

## Warforged & Dragonborn
Built as opposites: warforged were created to end the dragon empires. Their animosity endures, coded into memory and myth.

- **Warforged**: Engineered for divine war, seek purpose
- **Dragonborn**: Survivors of a divine purge, mistrustful
- **Conflict**: A feud carved in bolts and bones

---

## Giants
Once peak-rulers, now broken and exiled. Giants live at the world’s edge, dreaming of thunder that once obeyed.

---
