**Geographical Note**: The equator—called the *Celestial Meridian*—crosses the heart of Nevos. Climate shifts little latitudinally but drastically by terrain and season. The regions are aligned to ancient star-signs still invoked in ritual, law, and birth.

---

**Philosophy of the Realms**:  
Each region is not just land—it is **legacy**, shaped by a guiding celestial force. Star-aspects govern temperaments, cultures, and rites. Though divided, all thirteen remember the sky from which their names were born.
