  <h1>Celestial Elves of Solivane</h1>
  <p><em>“We are not born of stars, but we remember the first light.”</em></p>

  <h2>Faith and Function</h2>
  <p>Celestial Elves are the most devoted and enigmatic disciples of <strong>Solivane</strong>, the divine light and guiding star of the heavens. They believe Solivane is not merely a deity but the <em>first star</em>—the soul-flame from which all divine radiance is drawn.</p>
  <p>They serve not just as priests, but as keepers of stellar silence, guardians of radiant gates, and pilgrims of forgotten light.</p>

  <h2>Key Lore Integration</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Thousands of years ago, a sect of high elves entered communion with Solivane through starborn portals in the oldest temples. Their exposure to what they call the <em>Unbound Radiance</em> altered them, stilling their aging and awakening the <strong>Starlit Soul</strong> within.</li>
    <li><strong>The Quiet Beyond:</strong> Nevos has an extraplanar space referred to by Celestial Elves as the <strong>Quiet Beyond</strong>—a celestial liminal zone surrounding Solivane’s light. It's accessible only through rare <strong>Solivane Gates</strong>, typically buried beneath sanctified ruins, asteroids, or drifting monastery-havens.</li>
    <li><strong>Temples & Portals:</strong> The Oldest Temples of Solivane—often cut from crystal-veined stone or grown from luminous vines—house permanent gates. These lead to shards of reality: small planetoids, silence chambers, and starlit void sanctuaries where monks, clerics, and paladins meditate, train, or ascend.</li>
    <li><strong>No Skyships:</strong> Commonfolk have never seen a skyship. Travel to the Quiet Beyond is a spiritual pilgrimage, not a technological endeavor. Celestial Elves vanish into light—not because of engines, but because they walk the path of radiance through ancient thresholds few understand.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Society & Role</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Orders & Monasteries:</strong> Celestial Elves form small monastic enclaves, often high in mountains, deep in ruins, or floating within the Quiet Beyond. They're devoted to domains of <em>Light, Knowledge, Peace, Order,</em> and <em>War</em>, depending on their aspect of Solivane’s light.</li>
    <li><strong>Paladins:</strong> They are <strong>Stellar Wardens</strong>—blazing swords of truth and divine order. Oath of the Ancients and Oath of Devotion are common.</li>
    <li><strong>Clerics:</strong> Considered <strong>Lightbearers</strong> or <strong>Chroniclers of Radiance</strong>, their divine magic reflects Solivane’s ever-burning truth.</li>
    <li><strong>Monks:</strong> The <strong>Silent Harmony</strong> sect practices the <em>Way of the Astral Self</em> or <em>Sun Soul</em>, channeling internal divine light into radiant strikes.</li>
  </ul>
