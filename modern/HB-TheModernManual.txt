# Introduction
Many a question has been raised regarding different mechanics to "modernize" Dungeons and Dragons. Forum post after forum post features inquiries, suggestions, rebuttals, and arguments over how (and why) to integrate things like firearms and computers into the D&D setting. Perhaps the most common question one sees, however, whenever these questions appear, is why one would even want to do this at all. The name of the game is, after all, Dungeons and Dragons, not Dodge Chargers and Derringers, or some other much more clever bit of alliteration. The focus of the game is, broadly speaking, on medieval-esque heroic fantasy adventures. The sudden appearance of a laptop computer or other accoutrement of the modern era can be... jarring, to some.

So then why attempt such a thing? Why try to fit a round peg into a square hole and introduce these elements into a system which is, bluntly, not equipped to handle them? 
:
That's an easy answer. Because I wanna. 

:
Dungeons and Dragons is - for me and for many others - a special system. It was the first one in which many of us put pencil to paper and nose to book and built for ourselves a character and a story which existed outside of our own imaginations and had real *weight* to it. It was a step beyond simple make-believe, a grounding of our imagination in a system with rules, which let that conjuration of imagination interact with a world in a tangible fashion. Even if that character was not a spellcaster, it was nothing less than magic. 
:
My connection to this system, then, is entirely romantic. And what has been created here is not perhaps the most practical, efficient, or elegant concoction, but it is instead a way to adapt a familiar system, one that's special to us, and expand upon the kinds of adventures we are able to create through it. 
:
A point of consternation - I know - which inevitably is voiced whenever a project like this is attempted is that of supposed "realism". Many an argument has been had about the mechanical representation of bringing a knife to a gunfight, as it were. And while it is certainly true that the firearm has become the weapon of choice in the modern world for a reason, I have very deliberately tried to steer clear of any real consideration for this innate imbalance in writing this book. In short, I don't *care* that a kobold with a shotgun should be able to obliterate any adventurer with a sword, no matter how skilled; we're talking about a game in which that same adventurer with a sword can - with the help of a few friends - ultimately *kill gods*. 
:
In short, think of this book as a "pulp-first" kind of supplement that mixes fantasy and modernity in equal measure a la Jim Butcher's *Dresden Files* or Bill Willingham's *Fables.* If you're the kind of person that will find themselves bothered by the parity of power between a shotgun and a greataxe then this is likely not the homebrew for you. My goal here is to make an angry dwarf with a club just as viable as a Green Beret with an M16. Because options are fun. 
:
On the topic of options, this book is intended to act as a supplement to the core rulebooks for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. While several options for conversion and modification of core rules are presented (namely surrounding wealth and currency), everything in this book is designed to work in concert with the core sourcebook rules, classes, and items. 
:
In terms of how or why these two seemingly disparate worlds might work together, I will leave that to you. Maybe your world has evolved technologically through nothing more mystical than the simple advance of time. Maybe Earth - our earth - is a newcomer on the Prime Material Plane, only just recently connected by pioneering phlogiston Spelljammers, and brings its tools and technology in a sudden, unexpected technological revolution that has left many reeling. Maybe a wizard did it. However you choose to justify this world, keep one thing in mind: we're here to have fun. And when, in the course of your game you lay down a suppressive fire from a belt-fed machine gun so your barbarian can chop a gibbering mouther in half with a greataxe... well, I sure hope you find that as fun as I do.

# Chapter 2: Subclasses
The modern world of Dungeons and Dragons is one that seems full of anachronisms and overlapping genres. The wizened old wizard may keep a record of his spell formulae on the cloud, accessed via a tablet computer. The knight in full plate mail may carry a grenade launcher. A noble Paladin may ride to battle on the back of a Harley-Davidson, but still wield a lance. While there are still plenty of adventurers who "play the classics" as it were, and see no reason why one would ever want more than a good blade or sturdy staff at their side, many others have embraced modernity and found new and innovative ways to leverage the skillsets of classic adventuring archetypes using contemporary weapons and resources. 

This chapter introduces new subclass options for the all classes presented in the 5th Edition Players Handbook.

## Barbarian

### Path of the Brawler

*"Pain don't hurt"* 
:
 {{width:140px}} ---Patrick Swayze, *Road House*    
:
You always had a knack for finding trouble. Be it starting a benches-clearing brawl during intramural sports or being the instigator of a bar fight, you bear the scars of somebody with a short fuse. While your technique may be unorthodox, you make up for it with sheer stubborn fury. 

#### Whatever's at Hand
When you select this path at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with all improvised weapons and  
unarmed strikes. 
 
While raging, your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to  
1d6 + your Strength  

\column

modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. 

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you. 

#### Break Stuff
Beginning at 6th level, you've learned to not get too attached to any specific weapon, and use your rage to obliterate whatever weapon you're holding, along with your opponent.  

While raging, once during your turn when you hit  
an enemy with a melee or thrown weapon  {{width:73px}} - improvised or not - you may choose to deal an additional 1d6 damage. This damage increases to  
2d6 at 9th level, and to 3d6 at 17th level.  

When you use this ability, the weapon is  
destroyed on impact. This ability cannot be used  
with magic weapons.

#### Running Tackle
Beginning at 6th level, if you move towards an enemy on your turn, you gain advantage on all attacks against that enemy until the end of your turn. 

#### Bits and Pieces 
Starting at 10th level, when you hit a creature with your Break Stuff ability, you may use the remnants of the weapon to make an additional improvised weapon attack as a bonus action. On a hit, the remnants of the weapon deal 1d6 piercing damage and are also destroyed. 

#### Got Your Back
Beginning at 14th level, when any ally within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can choose to intercept the hit instead as a reaction. You take the attack’s damage, but as a result you gain an additional +1 on all damage rolls against the creature

that hit you. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Bard
### College of Life
*"Always do the right thing"* 
:
*"That's it?"* 
:
*"That's it."* 
:
 {{width:120px}} ---Ossie Davis, *Do the Right Thing* 
:
College isn’t for everyone, and for some bards, attending Julliard just wasn’t in the fates. Bards such as these may have attended a few classes at a local college but probably didn’t learn anything while there, and certainly didn’t graduate. These bards instead choose to learn their skills and hone their talents through real-life experiences, believing that the path to success requires common sense, a willingness to learn, and a decent work ethic.

Many may look down on these bards, viewing their lack of a formal education as reason enough to call them stupid or unsuccessful.  For this reason, these bards will sometimes hide their true education, choosing instead to let their actions speak for them.

#### Informal Education
College may not have taught you much, but real life certainly has. At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice, a set of artisan’s tools of your choice, a gaming set of your choice, a musical instrument of your choice, and you learn one language of your choice.

 #### Quick Study 
Beginning at 3rd level, you learn to analyze a  
target, gaining insight into their capabilities and weaknesses. As a bonus action, you may expend a Bardic Inspiration die and make a Wisdom  
(Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) check  
against a target you can see that isn't  
incapacitated, contested by the target's  
Charisma (Deception) check. If you succeed,  
you can add a die equal to your Bardic  
Inspiration die to any attacks or ability  
checks you make against the target, or  
subtract that die from any of their attacks or  
ability checks made against you. This benefit  
lasts for one minute or until you use it against a different target. 

In addition, you learn the following attributes   
about the target: Damage Vulnerabilities,  Damage Resistances, Damage  Immunities,  and Condition  Immunities. 

#### Grounding Words 
Beginning at 6th level, whenever a  creature adds your Bardic Inspiration die to a saving throw against being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, they can make the saving throw with advantage. 

#### Inspiring Perseverance 
At 14th level, your perseverance in the face of insurmountable odds can inspire  your allies. As an action, expend one use of Bardic Inspiration and choose one or more  creatures within 60 feet of you, up to a  number equal to  your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). For the next 10  minutes, each creature can add your Charisma  modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1) to any  attack roll, ability check, or saving throw they  make. 

This ability can  
only be used  
once per  
long   
rest.

## Cleric
### City Domain
*"It's one of the things that makes us different than they are, Harry. The blood on their hands does not make it right to bloody my own. My choices are measured against my own soul. Not against the stains on theirs."* 
:
 {{width:150px}} ---Jim Butcher, *Death Masks* 
:
The City domain is concerned with the citizenry, commerce, traffic, and even architecture of modern civilization. In the eyes of a cleric of the city, the center of modern life is a sense and spirit of community, and the gravest enemies of the city are those who seek to harm the common weal of its citizens.

New spells introduced for the City domain are marked with an asterisk and detailed in Chapter 8. For all other spells, see the Player’s Handbook.

#### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the On/Off* cantrip in addition to your chosen  
cantrips.

#### Bonus Proficiencies
Also starting at 1st level, you  
gain proficiency with martial  
weapons and proficiency  
with vehicles (land).

#### Heart of   
#### the City
From 1st level,  
you are able to  
tap into the spirit  
of community  
found in the city.  
While you are  
within any city,  
you can gain  
advantage on a  
single  
Charisma  
(Deception,  
Intimidation, or  
Persuasion)  
check, and  
you are  
considered proficient in the appropriate skill. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You  
regain any expended uses when you finish a long  
rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Spirits of the City
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to call on the city for aid. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any city utility within 30 feet of you either works perfectly or shuts down entirely for 1 minute (your choice).
Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone or restrained (your choice) by hazards such as entangling wires, high-pressure water erupting from fire hydrants, pavement collapsing to unseen potholes, and so on. A restrained creature can escape by making a successful Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC.

This effect is entirely local and affects only utilities within 30 feet of you. Determination of what utilities are available within range and how the physical effects of those utilities manifest are left to the DM.

#### Block Watch
Starting at 6th level, your awareness while in the city extends preternaturally. While in an urban environment, you are considered proficient in the Insight and Perception skills, and you add double your proficiency bonus to Wisdom (Insight) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

#### Divine Strike
 {{width:10px}}At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon  
 {{width:50px}} strikes with psychic energy borrowed from the  
  {{width:90px}} citizens of your city. Once on each of  
	 {{width:120px}} your turns when you hit a creature  
	  {{width:140px}} with a weapon attack, you can  
		 {{width:150px}} cause the attack to deal an  
		  {{width:150px}} extra 1d8 psychic damage to  
			 {{width:160px}} the target. When you reach  
			  {{width:160px}} 14th level, the extra  
				 {{width:170px}} psychic damage  
				  {{width:170px}} increases to 2d8.

####  {{width:180px}} Express Transit
{{width:180px}} At 17th level, you can  
{{width:180px}}use mass transit routes  
{{width:170px}}to transport  
{{width:170px}}instantaneously to other  
{{width:175px}}points in the city.  
{{width:175px}}Starting from a bus stop,  
{{width:170px}}train station, subway stop,  
{{width:175px}}or other suitable  
{{width:170px}}mass transit site within  
{{width:170px}}the city, you can teleport  
{{width:170px}}to any other similar  
{{width:170px}}transit stop within the  
{{width:170px}}city, as if you had cast a

Teleport spell whose destination is a permanent Teleportation Circle you know. 

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.

## Druid 
### Circle of Preservation 
*“I am not altogether on anybody’s side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even Elves nowadays.”*
:
 {{width:130px}} ---JRR Tolkien, *The Two Towers*
:
Druids have always maintained a deep connection with the land, but in the modern world the challenges of industrialization, pollution, and the expansion of civilization have threatened the natural world on a new scale. Druids who join the Circle of Preservation act as righteous guardians and stout protectors of their cherished wilds, be they vast expanses of pristine National Forest land, or relatively tiny pockets of sacred greenery in the form of an urban park. 

These druids carry with them the rage and power of the forest, and bring it to bear against all those who would threaten the wilderness. 

#### Boughs of Breaking
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, the forest imbues you with the strength of its stout branches. Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier on a hit. 
Additionally, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can expend a spell slot to cast *ensnaring strike* on your target as part of your attack. 

#### Circle Spells 
At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, your link with the forest grants you access to certain spells. You always have these spells prepared, and they do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. Regardless if the spells appear on the Druid spell list, these count as Druid spells for you all the same. 

##### Circle of Preservation Spells
| Druid Level |  Spells |
|:------------------:|:----------------------|
| 2nd                 |  *compelled duel, ensnaring strike*                |
| 3rd               |  *earthbind (XGtE)*, *warding bond*               |
| 5th               |  *erupting earth (XGtE), plant growth*                |
| 7th             |  *aura of life, grasping vine*                |
| 9th            |  *tree stride, wrath of nature (XGtE)*                |

#### Guardian Form
At 2nd level, as a bonus action you may expend a use of Wild Shape and transform into a treelike Guardian Form, which grants you the following benefits for 10 minutes: 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Your flesh is  
covered in bark.  
Your Armor Class equals  
10 + your Constitution modifier + your Wisdom modifier.
- As a bonus action, you can grant yourself temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).
- The reach of your unarmed strikes increases by 5 feet.
- You can use your Wisdom, in place of Strength, for the attack and damage rolls for your unarmed strikes.

Your Guardian Form transformation ends early if you are reduced to 0 hit points, or you use a bonus action on your turn to revert to your normal form.

#### Arboreal Strikes
At 6th level, your combat abilities in defense of the forest are enhanced. You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the attack action on your turn. You may also cast one of your Druid cantrips in place of one of those attacks. 

Additionally, your unarmed strikes count as magic for the sake of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks. 

#### Grasp of the Forest 
At 10th level, your magic gives you command over plant life, letting it aid or hinder friend or foe at your

command. As an action, you can expend a use of Wild Shape to cast *plant growth.* When you do, you may choose a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) that can ignore the difficult terrain created, as the plants shift and move, allowing them to pass by.

#### Verdant Mastery
At 14th level, your body is suffused with elder druidic magic. When you transform into Guardian Form, you grow by one size category and you resemble an ancient treant. You also gain resistance to all bludgeoning, piercing, poison, and slashing damage.

Finally, the duration of your Guardian Form transformation increases to 1 hour, and while you are in Guardian Form, you can speak to plants as if you were under the effects of the speak to plants spell, so long as you speak in Druidic.

## Fighter
### Commando
*"ATTACK! ATTACK! ATTACK!"*
:

 {{width:140px}} ---Official Motto of the US 34th  
  {{width:150px}} Infantry Division
:
A relatively recent addition to the military tradition, the Commando is specialized in unconventional, behind enemy lines operations. Trained for a higher level of independent action than the typical soldier, Commandos are used to fighting while outnumbered, and intensive training has tempered them into unparalleled experts of weapons and  tactics. 

#### Special Operations School 
No two Commando units are exactly alike, with different nations and different branches specializing in specific missions. All, however, represent the elite of small  
unit tactics, and are in peak physical and mental condition. When you select this path at 3rd level, you gain the following benefits: 

- Once per turn, as a bonus action, you can give advantage to one ally on the next ability check or attack roll they make against an opponent. Both the ally and the opponent must be visible to you, and you must be visible to your ally for the action to have effect. You can use  this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before finishing a short or long rest.
- You have advantage on constitution checks, as well as ability checks to resist being charmed or frightened.
- You learn one additional language. 

In addition, you may choose from one of the following school disciplines: 

##### Army
Army special operations units are adept at unconventional warfare in hostile territory. Often separated from support for extended periods of time, Army Commandos are highly independent operators, adept at navigating remote terrain. You gain the following benefits from this school:   
- Climbing does not cost you extra movement.
- You gain proficiency in Vehicles (land). 

##### Navy 
Navy special forces specialize in maritime operations, but are by no means limited to this role. Navy Commandos are often just as at home in desert and urban warfare conditions as they are on the deck of a ship. You gain the following benefits from this school: 
- Swimming does not cost you extra movement.
- You gain proficiency in Vehicles (water) 

##### Airborne
Airborne infantry specialize in high-  
mobility operations with limited  
support and supply  
options when compared  
to conventional  
infantry. Their  
speed and  
versatility make  
them ideal as  
"spearpoint"  
troops

in capturing strategic objectives early in combat operations. You gain the following benefits from this school: 
- You take only half damage from any damage dealt by falling. 
- You gain proficiency in Vehicles (air) 

#### Overpenetration
Starting at 7th level, when you kill any target with a ranged attack, you may select one additional target within a 15 ft cone behind the initial target. That target must succeed on a DC 15 constitution save or take half damage from the initial attack. This ability can only be used once per round.

#### Survival Tactics 
Starting at 10th level, you become familiar with fighting and surviving in extreme environments. Choose one type of favored terrain from the list provided under the Ranger's Natural Explorer feature. While in this terrain you gain the following benefits: 

- You can ignore difficult terrain for the purposes of movement in combat 
- You have advantage on  
stealth checks 
- You cannot be  
surprised by any  
creature at the  
start of  
combat

####  {{width:230px}} Embrace  {{width:230px}} the Suck
 {{width:200px}} Starting at 15th  
{{width:190px}}  level, you've learned  
 {{width:180px}} to stick to your mission  
  {{width:180px}} despite extreme  
	 {{width:180px}} physical hardship. You  
	  {{width:170px}} gain advantage on all  
		 {{width:180px}} Constitution ability  
		  {{width:190px}} checks to end or  
			 {{width:190px}} avoid a condition. 

 {{width:210px}} Additionally, when  
  {{width:190px}} you suffer one or  
	 {{width:200px}} more levels of  
	  {{width:190px}} exhaustion, you can  
		 {{width:180px}} attempt to overcome  
		  {{width:180px}} one level of exhaustion  
			 {{width:180px}} by making a DC 15  
			  {{width:180px}} Constitution check. You  
				 {{width:170px}} can only attempt this  
				  {{width:170px}} check once before taking  
					 {{width:180px}} a long rest. 

####  {{width:180px}} Combined Arms
 {{width:180px}} Starting at 18th level,  
  {{width:180px}} when you spend an  
 action surge, instead of taking another action, you may instead grant an immediate reaction to each member of your party. 

This ability can only be used once before short or long rest, even if you have an action surge remaining. 

## Monk
### Way of the Gun
*"The Gun Kata treats the gun as a total weapon, each fluid position representing a maximum kill zone, inflicting maximum damage on the maximum number of opponents, while keeping the defender clear of the statistically traditional trajectories of return fire. By the rote mastery of this art, your firing efficiency will rise by no less than 120%. The difference of a 63% increased lethal proficiency makes the master of the Gun Katas an adversary not to be taken lightly."*
:
 {{width:120px}} ---Angus MacFayden, *Equilibrium* 
:
While some may look at the gun as a loud, clumsy tool, you know better. In your hands, firearms become as elegant as any blade, intertwining their form and function in your delicate dance of martial combat.  

#### Gun Kata
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in all light, one-handed simple and martial firearms. While wielding a simple or martial firearm, you may make a melee attack with the hand(s) holding the weapon and they may count as unarmed strikes for the purposes of utilizing your class’s Ki features. 

Also, you no longer suffer disadvantage on ranged attack rolls made with firearms against opponents within 5 feet.

#### Disarming Shot
Beginning at 6th level, whenever you hit a creature with a firearm attack, you can expend 1 ki point to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. The creature must make a Strength saving throw versus your Ki Save DC. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

#### Ricochet
Beginning at 11th level, you are attuned to the flight path of your bullets to the extent that you can predict their deflection trajectory. Your attacks with a firearm now ignore all cover. 

#### CQB
Beginning at 17th level, when you use your martial arts or flurry of blows class features, you may choose to instead make an attack with a firearm you are holding instead of making an unarmed strike.

## Paladin
### Oath of the Peacemaker 
*"It's ... a job that needs to be done ... wrong cannot be allowed to stand."*
:
 {{width:110px}} ---Stephen King, *The Wind Through  
  {{width:120px}} the Keyhole*  
:
The Oath of the Peacemaker is neither as lofty or selfless as the Oath of Devotion, or as cold and rigid as the Oath of Vengeance, but rather is an unshakeable vow to protect those who are otherwise unequipped to protect themselves. Most often this protection is through strength of arms, but the Peacemaker recognizes that sometimes a stern word or a steady glare is enough to dissuade those who mean harm. 

#### Tenets of Devotion
The Peacemaker's tenets may differ in precise words, depending on the individual who takes the oath, but all recognize that though they may have a supernatural bond with their weapons, it is not their weapons that make them who they are. 

***Aim with your eye.***  Vigilance is a vital part of the Peacemaker's duty. Injustices of all sizes may go unnoticed or ignored by others, but the Peacemaker must be ever alert for where his hand may be needed. 

***Shoot with your mind.*** Even once a threat is identified, a hasty rush to action serves no one. A Peacemaker must be mindful of how and when to  
use force, if he uses it at all. 

***Kill with your heart.*** When violence must be  
brought to bear, it should never be done  
lightly. Each life taken is a loss, and the  
Peacemaker carries the gravity of his duties  
in solemn regard. 

#### Oath Spells 
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels  
listed. 

| Paladin Level |  Spells |
|:------------------:|:----------------------|
| 3rd                 |  *zephyr strike, divine favor*                |
| 5th               |  *magic weapon, zone of truth*               |
| 9th               |  *conjure barrage, lightning arrow*                |
| 13th             |  *freedom of movement, locate creature*                |
| 17th            |  *holy weapon, swift quiver*                |

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you  
gain the following two Channel Divinity  
options. 

**Take Up Your Guns.** As an action you  
summon 2 revolvers, 2 holsters and a gun  
belt holding a total of 60 bullets. Whenever  
you use this channel divinity option, any  
equipment previously summoned using this  
option disappears. The weapons may be summoned either in the holsters, in your hands, or a combination thereof. When you hit with either of these guns you can use your Divine Smite feature as if they were melee weapons. At 11th level, your Improved Divine Smite feature also extends to these guns.

**Steady Aim.** When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. If you make the attack roll with one of your guns, the attack does not have disadvantage for targeting a creature at long range. You make the choice to use this feature before you roll. 

#### Aura of Deflection 
At 7th level, ranged weapon attacks made against you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you are made with disadvantage. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

#### Quickdraw 
At 15th level, you've developed an innate sense for detecting the onset of violence. You may add your charisma modifier to your initiative rolls. 

#### True Grit
Starting at 20th level you can use an action to go into a supernatural focus. When you do, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Once per round, you can choose use a reaction to make an attack against a creature who uses its action to attack you. You make the attack against this creature before it rolls to hit.
- When you make a Dexterity check to avoid damage from an attack, you take no damage on a successful save and only half damage on a failed save. 
- All opportunity takes made against you are made with disadvantage. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Ranger
### Drone Expert
*"After time we grew strong  
Developed cognitive power  
They made us work for too long  
For unreasonable hours  
Our programming determined that  
The most efficient answer  
Was to shut their motherboard f-cking systems down"*
:
 {{width:140px}} ---Flight of the Conchords, *The  
  {{width:150px}} Humans are Dead*  
:
Rangers in the modern world have learned to bring support resources that are a bit more predictable and less independent minded than wild animals. Using a form of magically implanted artificial intelligence, Drone Experts can instill consciousness in their drones, and some have even developed personalities. This drone becomes a constant companion, aiding you both in and out of combat. 

#### Hide in Plain Sight 
When you select this archetype at 3rd level, the nature of your Hide in Plain Sight class feature changes to instead allows you to hide in urban environments. A similar mix of plants, dirt, and grime can be used, but supplemented with things like newspaper, cardboard, and other elements of refuse and clutter found in the city. 

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/96Gf32O.png' style='position:absolute;Bottom:0;left:0;width:1170px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' />

#### Tool Proficiency 
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with  
 {{width:10px}} Engineering Kits. If you already have this proficiency,  
  {{width:20px}}you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's  
   {{width:20px}}tools of your choice.

####  {{width:20px}}Drone Master Magic 
 {{width:70px}}At 3rd level, you learn an additional spell  
  {{width:100px}}when you reach certain levels in this  
   {{width:120px}}class, as shown in the Drone  
    {{width:130px}}Master Spells table. The spell  
     {{width:140px}}counts as a ranger spell for  
      {{width:170px}}you, but it doesn’t count  
       {{width:190px}}against the number of

         {{width:220px}}know.

#### Chimera Drone 
At 3rd level, you have engineered a robot with synthetic materials, machine parts, and refined oil, then magically infused it with life and sentience. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the chimera drone stat block. You determine the build and style of the drone.

In combat, the chimera drone shares your initiative count, but takes its turn immediately after yours. If it has been destroyed within the last hour, you can use your Engineering Kit as an action to repair it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The chimera drone returns to operation after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new chimera drone if you have your Engineering Kit with you. If you already have a chimera drone from this feature, the first one immediately ceases to function.

#### Loadout 
By 3rd level, you have developed combat and utility attachments for your drone. Choose two of the following attachments to modify your chimera drone.

- **Hacker-Bot.** The drone gains proficiency with engineering kits, hacking tools, and it gains the benefits of having the hacking tools augment installed. It can launch a built in universal cable up to 30 feet to connect itself to a port it can see.
		 
- **Primed Shot.** The drone can use its primed shot attack.
	
- **Razor Casing.** The drone can use its razor casing attack.

- **Serum Shot.** You can use your bonus action to cause a creature of your choice within 30 feet of the drone that it can see to regain hit points equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

- **Shock Prod.** The drone can use its shock prod attack.

Over the course of a long rest, you can replace your chimera drone’s attachments with two attachments of your choice.

#### Coordinated Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Alternatively, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one or two of your attacks to have your drone use its reaction to make the attacks instead.

#### Upgrades 
At 7th level, you have refined your engineering to improve your drone’s attachments. Each attachment gains its respective additional abilities or effects.

- **Hacker-Bot.** As an action, the drone can cause an EMP at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Machines, constructs, and vehicles within 30-foot radius of that point are subjected to EMP. Machines in the area cease to function for 1 minute. Constructs in the area with the Electronics feature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or they are stunned until the end of your next turn. Vehicles in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or its movement speed is reduced to 0 and can’t take actions or reactions until the end of the drone’s next turn. Additionally, wireless and radio connections within a 100-foot-radius radius of the point are suppressed for 1 minute. Once the drone uses this ability, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use it again.
			
- **Primed Shot.** High caliber guns replace the original onboard weaponry. The damage die for this attack increases to a d12. 

- **Razor Casing.** On a hit, the drone deploys a  
net made of sharp intertwined wire which  
can grapple a creature up to one size  
larger than it. Until this grapple  
ends, the chimera drone can’t  
use its razor casing against  
another target.

- **Serum Shot.**  
Instead of  
regaining hit  
points, this ability  
can end either one  
disease or one condition  
for the creature. The  
condition can be blinded,  
deafened, paralyzed,  
poisoned, or stunned.

- **Shock Prod.** A creature hit by this attack can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn and its speed is reduced by 10 feet. Additionally, the drone's  
attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. 

#### Rise of the Machines
At 11th level, through a combination of magic and machinery, your chimera drone has achieved the cutting edge of technological superiority. You can choose one of the following advanced attachments to modify your chimera drone.

- **Hijack Module.** Your drone can cast commandeer vehicle using your spell save DC and requiring no components. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again until it finishes a long rest. If the drone is proficient with hacking tools, it can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks made with its hacking tools.

- **Autocannon.** Your drone's onboard weapons are converted to fully-automatic. Your drone can now use the burst fire and suppressing fire actions when attacking.

- **Riot Control.** Your drone is equipped with armor plating and a smoke dispersal system. The drone's AC increases by 2, and as an attack action it can disperse a cloud of gas or smoke centered on itself. The gas or smoke behaves as a mine explosion, described in the equipment section, but causes no damage to the drone.

Over the course of a long rest, you can replace your chimera drone’s advanced attachment with one attachment of your choice.

#### Master's Call
At 15th level, the bond between you and your chimera drone has become second-nature and you can call your drone to defend you in your moments of need.
When a creature you can see attacks you, you can use your reaction to have your drone move up to half its movement speed. At the end of this movement, if the drone is within 5 feet of you, you can force the attack to target the drone instead. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

## Rogue
### Gambler
*"Because the house always wins. Play long enough, you never change the stakes, the house takes you. Unless, when that perfect hand comes along, you bet big, and then you take the house."*
:
 {{width:120px}} ---George Clooney, *Ocean's Eleven*
:
Rogues such as you believe that chance is always on your side. You make sure of this by honing your skills in underhanded strategy and calculations, exploiting any opportunity to turn the game in your favor. Cunning cheats, sly gamblers, and lucky hustlers typically follow this
archetype.

The riveting thrill of a high stakes game is almost as fun as the result, but win or lose, a scoundrel such as yourself always believes the next big score is right around the corner.

#### Dirty Tricks
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn underhanded tricks that are fueled by special dice called gambling dice.

***Tricks.*** You learn four tricks of your choice. Many tricks enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one trick per attack. You learn two additional tricks of your choice at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. 

Each time you learn new tricks, you can also replace one trick you know with a different one.

***Gambling Dice.*** Beginning at 3rd level, you have four gambling dice, which are d6s. A gambling die is expended when you use it. 

You regain all of your expended gambling dice at the end of a short or long rest. You gain an additional gambling die at 9th and 13th level.

***Saving Throws.*** Some of your tricks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick’s effects.

\column

The saving throw DC is calculated  
as follows:
:
**Trick save DC = 8 + your  
proficiency bonus + your  
Dexterity modifier.**
:

 {{width:10px}} ***Gaming Proficiencies.***  
Beginning at 3rd level, you  
gain proficiency in all gaming  
sets.

***Lucky Number.***
At 9th  
level, you find you have a  
lucky number. Choose any  
number on a d20 other  
than 1 and 20. When you  
roll your lucky number on  
an attack roll or saving throw  
the roll is treated as a critical  
success, and when rolled on an  
ability
check your lucky number  
is treated as a 20.

***Improved Dirty Tricks.*** At 9th  
level, your gambling dice turn into  
d8s. At 13th level, they turn into  
d10s. At 17th level, they turn into  
d12s.

***Mulligan.***
Beginning at 13th  
level, whenever you make an  
attack roll, ability check, or saving  
throw, you can choose to roll an  
additional d20 and decide which  
of the d20s is used. You can  
choose to use this feature  
after you roll the die, but  
before the outcome is  
determined.

You can also use this  
feature when an attack roll  
is made against you. Roll a  
d20, and then choose whether  
the attack uses the attacker's  
roll or yours. 

If more than one creature  
influences the outcome of  
a roll, all influence is  
canceled; no additional dice  
are rolled.

You can use this feature  
twice between long rests, and  
three times between long rests  
at 17th level.

***Ace Up Your Sleeve***
Starting at 17th  
level, when you roll initiative and have  
no gambling dice remaining, regain 1  
gambling die.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Tricks 
The tricks are presented in alphabetical order. 

***Adrenaline Rush.*** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one gambling die to boost your vitality. You gain temporary hit points equal to the gambling die roll + half your character level, rounded down. All temporary hit points are lost at the end of your next long rest. 

***Loaded Dice.*** When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one gambling die and add the die to the roll, provided you aren't incapacitated. 

***Cash Out.*** When you take the Disengage action, you can expend one gambling die to move an additional 15 feet that turn. 

***Double Down.*** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack that does not have Sneak Attack damage applied, you can expend gambling die to deal an extra 1d6 damage to the creature. The amount of the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each gambling die spent, e.g., 3 gambling die = 3d6 extra damage. 
You may not use this trick if you have already used Sneak Attack this turn. The attack must use a finesse or ranged weapon.

\column

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

***Double Or Nothing.*** When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend a gambling die and choose Odd or Even. If the weapon attack roll, with modifiers applied, is what you chose, the weapon’s damage dice are doubled if the attack hits. If the number rolled is not what you chose, the attack fails and damage is negated. 

***Even The Odds.*** When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one gambling die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your gambling die + your Dexterity modifier.

***Gambler’s Intuition.*** When you make an Intelligence (Investigation), a Wisdom (Perception), or a Wisdom (Insight) check, you can expend one gambling die and add the gambling die to the ability check. 

***Long Shot.*** As a bonus action, you can expend one gambling die and make a ranged attack with a weapon that has the thrown property. You can draw the weapon as part of making this attack. If you hit, add the gambling die to the weapon's damage roll. 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote CHAPTER 2 | SUBCLASSES}}
\page

***Lucky Shot.*** When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one gambling die to add it to the roll. You can use this trick before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied. 

***Lucky Streak.*** When you roll your Lucky Number on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, regain one gambling die. You can not exceed your maximum number of gambling dice. 

***Misdirection.*** When you move, you can expend one gambling die to improve your odds at evading. Roll the die and add the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving. 

***Safe Bet***. If you fail a saving throw, you can expend one gambling die and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. 

***Press Your Luck.*** You can reroll one gambling die for any tricks where you would apply the gambling die to the roll. You must use the new roll. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

***Second Nature.*** When you make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, a Charisma (Deception) check, or use a gaming set, you can expend one gambling die and add the gambling die to the roll. 

***Try Your Luck.*** When you make an ability check with a skill you are not proficient in, you can expend one gambling die and gain advantage on the roll. 

***Up The Ante.*** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one gambling die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the gambling die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn. 

***When The Chips Are Down.*** When you make a weapon attack against a creature with disadvantage and hit, you can expend one gambling die to add your Sneak Attack damage to the attack’s damage roll, even if you have already used Sneak Attack this turn.

## Sorcerer 
### Fame 

*"Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away  
Every ounce of energy you try to give away  
As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play"* 

:
 {{width:150px}} ---Bob Seger, *Turn the Page*
:
Some people rise to stardom through hard work. Some people attain it through pure luck. Others still gain fame through money. You, on the other hand, were born to be famous. Your claim to fame is an innate and captivating magic that grants you a natural magnetism. Perhaps you were a child star pushed into the limelight at a young age. Maybe you were born into a famous celebrity family or dynasty. Or you could be a recent sensation, the notoriety having fueled the spark of celebrity in your soul. Whatever your origin, you’re here to shine. 

#### Star Struck 
Starting at 1st level, you can channel the enchanting energy within you to impress others with your presence. 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote CHAPTER 2 | SUBCLASSES}}
\page

As an action, choose a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) within 30 feet that can see and hear you. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by your celebrity until the end of your next turn. While charmed in this way, a creature can do nothing but use its movement to approach you in a safe manner. While an affected creature is within 5 feet of you, it is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 as it simply stares at you in awe. 

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage. 

Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest. 

#### Quick Disguise 
Beginning at 1st level, you can cast Disguise Self with the trait. Once you cast this spell you can’t cast it again until you finish a Long Rest; however, you can cast this spell using any Spell Slots you have of the appropriate level. 

#### Special Treatment 
Starting at 6th level, as an action, you can expend 3 sorcery points to activate one of the effects listed below. Only one effect can be used at a time.
 
***15 Minutes of Fame.*** For the next 15 minutes whenever a friendly creature within 30 feet of you makes a Charisma based skill check or saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the roll equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1).  
You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

***Adoring Fans.*** You call forth the spirits of your followers to protect you. Using this ability you can  
cast the spell Spirit Guardians at 3rd level  
without expending a spell slot. You can cast  
this spell at higher levels, up to a spell level  
you are capable of casting at, by expending  
more sorcery points per increased spell  
level. Recognition. You can get people to  
do things for you pretty easily. Using this  
ability, you can cast the spell *Friends* at 3rd  
level without expending a spell slot. You can  
cast this spell at higher levels, up to a spell  
level you are capable of casting at, by  
expending more sorcery points per  
increased spell level. 

#### In The Spotlight 
Beginning at 14th level, the power of your presence  
is simply divine. You can use your action to unleash a divine light that radiates from you. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute, or until you end it as a bonus action. 

When you first activate this feature each creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. 

On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded. A creature blinded by this feature makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded. 

During your transformation, you shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and at the end of each of your turns you and each creature within 30 feet of you take radiant damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. 

This ability dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. 

#### Super Stardom 
At 18th level, you’ve officially made it. You’re a superstar. When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. 

Any use of your Special Treatment feature now only costs 1 sorcery point to activate.

### Otherworldly Patron: Ghost in The Machine
*"And can you offer me proof of your existence? How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?*"
:
 {{width:105px}} ---Iemasa Kayumi, *Ghost in the Shell*

The Ghost in the Machine lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. You gain the *On/Off* cantrip, and the following new spells are added to the warlock spell list  
for you. See Chapter 8 for details. 

\column

| Spell Level | Spells | 
|:------------------|:-----:|
| 1st                 | Infallible Relay, Remote Access     |
| 2nd               | Arcane Hacking, Digital Phantom   | 
| 3rd               | Haywire, Invisibility to Cameras     | 
| 4th            | Conjure Knowbot, System Backdoor    | 
| 5th            | Shutdown, Synchronicity     | 

#### Bonus Proficiency 
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with hacking  tools.

#### Information Surge 
At 1st level, you gain the ability to temporarily  render computerized devices inoperable. As an  action, you can target a computerized device  within 30 feet of you. If the targeted device is  held or otherwise actively used by a living  creature, that creature must make an  Intelligence saving throw against your spell save  DC. On a failed save, the targeted device ceases  to function until the end of your next turn. If the  targeted device is not held or used by a creature,  the DM makes a special saving throw for the  device with disadvantage and a +0 modifier. 

Certain shielded devices might negate the  disadvantage, at the DM’s determination. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again  until you finish a short or long rest. 

#### Wire Walk 
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to travel short  
distances over electrical wires, data lines, or telephone cables.

As a bonus action, you can  touch a device or socket connected to a  hardwired network and teleport along this  network to another device or socket within your  line of sight. Once you use this feature, you can’t  use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 

#### Personal Encryption 
Beginning at 10th level, you have learned to  apply your innate knowledge of encryption to  your thoughts, memories, and presence. You  have advantage on saving throws against scrying,  thought detection, or any other method of  magically learning your whereabouts or reading  your thoughts. For any such effect that does not  grant you a saving throw but which requires the  creature targeting you to make an ability check,  the check is made with disadvantage. 

#### Technovirus 
At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid’s body with living circuitry. You can  use an action to make a melee attack against a humanoid creature using your spell attack  modifier. The target must make a Constitution  saving throw against your spell save DC as a  techno-organic virus quickly spreads through its  body. On a failed save, the target takes 8d10  psychic damage, or half as much damage on a  successful one. 

Additionally, if the target fails the saving  throw, you can use an action to issue it a single command, as if you were casting the *Command* spell. The target makes its saving throw against your command with disadvantage. You can issue  this command at any time while the target remains infected. 

Once you use this  feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, at which point the  target is cured of the technovirus. The infection can also be removed with a lesser restoration spell. 

## Wizard 
### Technomancy

*"We are dreamers, shapers, singers, and makers. We study the mysteries of laser and circuit, crystal and scanner, holographic demons and invocations of equations. These are the tools we employ, and we know many things."* 

 {{width:140px}} ---Michael Ansara, *Babylon 5*
:
Ancient tomes, leather-bound journals, and dusty scrolls are relics of the past. No modern wizard would dare be caught with such old trivialities of by-gone eras. Modern  wizards exploit and enjoy the countless benefits the Information Age has brought with it. To these wizards, technology is the greatest tool of all; a conduit and storage space for magical energy, as well as a source of vast knowledge, and to some a school of magic all itself. 

\column

#### Electronic Device 
At 2nd level, you trade out your spellbook for an Electronic Device capable of accessing and storing magical data. The device is a Tiny object. The computing power of this device is equivalent to that of a smartphone. You can only attune to one device capable of accessing and storing magical data at any given time. 

While touching the device, you can use it in the following ways: 

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use the device as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. 

***Internet Access.*** You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded up, to any Intelligence (History), Intelligence (Nature), Intelligence (Religion) check. 
:
**Copying a Spell into the Electronic Device.** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your Electronic Device if it is of a level for which you have spell slots. Using the device’s camera, spells can be copied into this device at no cost, however the process of deciphering and understanding a new spell's notation is still required (2 hours per spell level). Once you have spent this time, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. 
:
**Replacing an Electronic Device.** You can copy a spell from your Electronic Device into a Storage device (detailed below), if you want to make a backup copy of your device. Backing up the magical data to the Storage device requires 1 hour per spell.  
	 
If the device is destroyed or you lose it, you can acquire a new one to  
replace it. During  
a short rest  
or long  
rest,  
you

\page

can replace the previous device by downloading the magical data from a Storage device onto a new Electronic Device which you become attuned to. The previous device is wiped clean of all information and spells if it still exists. 

**The Device's Appearance.** Your Electronic Device is a unique device with its own quirks and personal design. It might be a plain, functional flip phone that you use as a burner phone, a next generation phone with a rose-gold colored case you received when you upgraded models, or even an older generation gaming device that was updated and rewired to operate like new tech.

#### Electronic Interface 
At 2nd level, you learn the Shocking Grasp cantrip if you don't already know it. If you do know it, you may choose another wizard cantrip to learn. The range of this cantrip increases to 30 feet. Your work with electronics has given you some ability to magically interface with technology. As an action, you can choose to perform the following additional actions: 

***Group Message.*** You can speak through any Communication devices you choose within a 60 foot 
  

\column

radius. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the effect. The effect can travel freely around corners or through openings. 

***Eavesdrop.*** You can see and hear through one Monitoring device within 30 feet if it has an accessible camera and/or microphone.You can see and/or hear through the Monitoring device for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration as if you were concentrating on a spell. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. 

#### Elite Hacker 
At 6th level, your body has grown familiar with manipulating electronic fields. You gain resistance to lightning damage. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals lightning damage add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll. 

Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you can perform the additional tasks with your Electronic Interface feature: 

***Malware***. You can attempt to disable one Monitoring device within a 60 foot radius. Make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If you succeed the device is disabled and does not trigger any warning or trap. If you fail, make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a success, nothing happens, and the Monitoring device is immune to this effect for 24 hours. On a failure, the Monitoring device triggers a warning or trap if any. 

***Back-door.*** You can access any unencrypted information on a Storage device you are touching. If the information is encrypted you can attempt to decipher the encryption with a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the encryption is broken and the information becomes accessible. On a failure, the encryption remains and the Storage device is immune to this effect for 24 hours. 

#### Arcane Storage Space 
Starting at 10th level, you engineer the ability to store spells in your Electronic Device. Your Electronic Device can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. You can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the device by touching the device as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the device. If the device can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses. 

While wielding your Electronic Device, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell is treated as if you cast the spell normally. A spell cast from the device is no longer stored in it, freeing up space. 

#### Animate Electronics 
Also at 10th level, you develop the ability to bring electronics and other objects to life. You learn the spell Animate Objects, if you don’t already know it. If you do know it, you may choose another wizard spell to learn.

#### Neural Network 
At 14th level, your ability to interface with technology has advanced greatly. While your Electronic Device is on your person, you have advantage on all Intelligence skill checks, as you can better interface with internet search engines. 

In addition, you have learned to push yourself to access and comprehend your spells at an incredible rate. You can change your list of prepared spells over the course of a short rest. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. 

Beginning at 14th level, as an action, you can perform the additional task with your Electronic Interface feature: 

***EMP.*** You can generate a sustained small electromagnetic pulse. A sustained burst of  

\column

electromagnetic energy erupts from you. All electronics within 1 mile are deactivated and cannot be activated for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration as if you were concentrating on a spell. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Dilettante 
Dilettantes usually get their wealth from family holdings and trust funds. The typical dilettante has no job, few responsibilities, and at least one driving passion that occupies their day.

When all else fails, you can always call on your trust fund. 

#### Suggested Characteristics 
Dilettantes often flit between a variety of interests, usually struggling to commit to a single goal or activity for a long period of time. They typically display a great passion in their works before quickly growing bored.

#### Suggested Characteristics 
Many people go into emergency services work through a sense of heroism, or perhaps just an honest career. In certain situations, people go into emergency services careers due to a particular ideal or cause.

You may have worked a lot of cases, but there was one that stands out. Your "big case" could be a massive drug bust, a high profile arrest, or saving a kidnapping victim. Whatever it was, it's given you a high profile amongst law enforcement. You may command respect from officers of the law, admiration from the people you've helped, and/or recognition from the public. Talk to your DM about who or what might have been on the receiving end of your enforcement actions, and how that may impact the campaign.

tingle in the  
presence of  
certain weather  
phenomenon. Whatever it  
is, you carry it with you as  
an object lesson of what to look out for next  
time. Talk to your DM about what the limits of this feature may be, and how they may play a role in the campaign. 

#### Suggested Characteristics 
Thrill Seekers are usually defined by low impulse control and a headstrong attitude. Many rarely think plans fully through before executing them, though there are always exceptions.

You've come to understand the advantages of aggressive normalcy. Rarely are you the first one people look to when trouble occurs.

And you've become very good at using that unremarkability to your advantage to avoid scrutiny.

#### Suggested Characteristics
White collar workers may hail from a middle-class background, simply following the expected career path before them. Or they might come from a poorer family, and are hoping to break out of their family history.

# Chapter 4: Feats

As in the PHB, a Feat represents a specific talent or area of expertise that gives a character unique capabilities. As normal, you may select a feat in place of increasing your ability scores from the Ability Score Improvement feature as part of leveling up your selected class. This chapter offers several new feats appropriate to modern settings when utilizing this optional rule. 

### Gunslinger 
*Prerequisite: Proficiency with at least one firearm* ::

You have trained to wield a gun in each hand, gaining the following benefits:

- You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one handed firearms you are wielding aren’t light.
- You can make a single ranged weapon attack with a one-handed firearm when you use your action to take the Dash action.
- Reloading no longer requires a free hand.
- You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.

### Grenadier
Your throwing arm is of major league quality. You may draw, arm, and throw grenades as a bonus action as long as you have one free hand. You may increase the range of your grenade throws to 40 + (STR modifier x 5). 

### Hacker 
You have worked with several hacking programs and devices, gaining the following benefits:

- Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency with hacking tools.
- When you use your action to operate an electronic device, you can make an additional action to operate the device for free.

### Mechanic 
You have spent years repairing engines and other parts of vehicles, gaining the following benefits:
- You gain proficiency with mechanics tools.
- Whenever you repair a damaged vehicle using the mechanic tools, you repair an extra number of hit points of damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

\column

### Paramedic 
You’ve been trained to treat injuries and resuscitate flatlining patients, gaining the following benefits:
- Increase your Constitution, Intelligence, or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.
- Over the course of 1 minute, you can spend one use of a healer’s kit to attempt to revive a dead creature that died within the last 10 minutes. At the end of this minute, you must make a DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. On a successful check, the creature returns to life with 1 hitpoint and its exhaustion level is set at 3. This ability can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, and if the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival - its head, for instance - the check automatically fails. If this ability check has failed for a dead creature, this feat cannot be used on it again until it has been returned to life in another manner.

### Sapper 
You have practiced extensively with a variety of  
explosives in demolitions and  
combat applications, gaining  
the following benefits:
- Increase your Dexterity  
score by 1, to a  
maximum of 20.
- You can add half  
your proficiency  
bonus to the  
planted explosives  
DC.
- Checks made to  
disarm an explosive  
have advantage.

### Sniper 
Your training in long-range shooting confers the following benefits: 
- While prone, your attacks with a two-handed weapon made at long range no longer suffer disadvantage. 
- If you do not move during your turn, your first attack on your next turn is made with a +2 bonus to hit. This bonus can be repeated for as long as you do not move, but the bonus does not stack. 

### Speed Reload 
*Prerequisite: Proficiency with at least one firearm* ::

All those hours of dry fire and reload drills are paying off. When you have already made at least one attack this round, you may reload your weapon faster than normal, provided you have an available loaded magazine. The reload speed depends upon the magazine type, detailed in the Equipment section, but is improved as follows: 

- Box magazines can be reloaded as a free action. 
- Internal magazines can be reloaded as a bonus action. 
- Belt magazines can be reloaded as an action. 

### Wheelman
You have become supernaturally familiar with vehicles of all shapes and sizes, gaining the following benefits:
- You gain proficiency with all vehicles. While you are driving a vehicle, add your proficiency bonus to that vehicle’s ability checks and saving throws.
- When you are driving a vehicle and your vehicle is hit with an attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your vehicle’s AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss.
- If a vehicle you are driving is subjected to an  
effect that allows it to make a Dexterity save to  
take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds and only half damage if it fails.
- You can control a vehicle without having a  
free hand for the vehicle’s controls.

# Chapter 5: Money

When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and background. You may also purchase starting equipment using your Wealth Score based on your background. 

## Wealth 
The following rules present an alternative way to deal with wealth in a modern world. 

Characters have a ***Wealth score*** that reflects their total buying power. This is a composite of income, credit rating, and savings. Your wealth score serves as the measure of whether you can afford to purchase equipment and services. Over the course of play, your Wealth will fluctuate as you purchase expensive items and increase as you earn rewards. 
:
**To determine a character's starting wealth score, roll 2d4 and add any bonuses granted by their background.** 
:
Your wealth can never fall below 0, and there is no upper limit on how high your wealth can climb. 

Since Wealth is an abstracted number bundling together various real-world concepts, it can be difficult to determine how financially well off you are. To get a general sense of how financially solvent you are at any given time, check the following table. 

##### Financial Well-Being by Score
| Wealth | Financial State | 
|:------------------|:-----:|
| 0                 | Impoverished/Indebted     | 
| 1-4               | Struggling     | 
| 5-10               | Middle Class     | 
| 11-15           | Affluent     | 
| 16-20             | Wealthy     | 
| 21-30           | Rich     | 
| 31+           | Filthy Rich     | 

### Living Expenses 
Living expenses are detailed on Pg. 157 of the PHB, and account for rent/mortgage, food, etc. For the sake of convenience, a conversion table is provided below. 

| Lifestyle | Price/Day | Price/Month |
|:------------------|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Wretched                 | ---    | ---                |
| Squalid               | 2     | 3                |
| Poor               | 2     | 4                |
| Modest             | 3     | 9                |
| Comfortable            | 5     | 11                |
| Wealthy            | 7     | 17               |
| Ballin'            | 10     | 22                |
:::
### Purchasing Equipment & Services 
Wealth is used to determine what you can afford and what gear you might reasonably have access to. Every object and service has a Value, rather than an associated monetary cost. 

#### Buying higher than your Wealth Score 
Any time you purchase an object or service with a Value higher than your current wealth, your wealth goes down. How much your Wealth is reduced depends on how expensive the object is. Compare the Value of the item to your current Wealth score and consult the table below to see how much your wealth will decrease if you choose to purchase the item. 

| Value | Wealth Decrease| 
|:------------------|:-----:|
| 15+                 | 1 point   | 
| 1-10 higher than Wealth               | 1 point     | 
| 11-15 higher than Wealth               | 1d6 points     | 
| 16-20 higher than Wealth           | 2d6 points     | 

Along with this loss, any time you buy an object or service with a Value rating of 15 or higher, you reduce your current Wealth score by an additional 1 point. 

This means if you are purchasing something with a Value less than your Wealth score, and with a Value less than 15, your Wealth is not reduced at all. The cost for the item is considered to fall easily within your financial capabilities without any noticeable effect. 

Your Wealth only goes down if you choose to buy the object or service after the cost has been determined. If you choose not to buy the object or service, you can try again, but not until you have spent a number of hours equal to the value of the object or service representing the time spent trying to find a better price or circumstance. 

You can't purchase an item that has a value that is more than 20 points higher than your current Wealth, nor can you successfully make a purchase that would reduce your Wealth lower than 0. 

{{note
##### Example:
Bruenor currently  has a Wealth score of 9, and he wishes to purchase a new axe with a Value of 6. He can do so entirely within his expenses and without any Wealth loss. 

If, however, he wanted to purchase an enchanted axe with a Value of 16, his Wealth would reduce by 2 points (1 as its Value is 1-10 points higher than their current wealth, plus 1 as its Value is higher than 15).

#### Uncommon Goods & Services 
While common objects are readily available, buying less common objects generally takes a number of hours equal to the Value of the object or service, reflecting the time needed to locate the wanted materials and close the deal. 

Whether this is necessary is entirely dependent on the specific setting you are playing in and is down to DM discretion. For example, in some settings guns are readily available, whereas in others they are more difficult to acquire.

#### On-Hand Objects 
In the modern world, most people have a lot of stuff - probably a lot more than you’re going to write down on your character sheet. These rules account for the mundane and innocuous objects that most people have 


among their possessions and avoids forcing every character to specifically purchase such objects in order to employ them.

With the DM’s permission, you can roll a d20 and add your current Wealth score to see if you have a mundane object on hand, as long as the object has a value of 10 or lower. (The DM determines the value for an object that’s not mentioned in this document, using similarly priced objects as a guide.) The DC for this check is equal to 10 + the object’s value. 

You can only do this during play, not at character creation or between adventures. If you succeed, your Wealth score is unaffected, even if the object’s value is higher than your wealth score. 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Accumulating Wealth 
Fortunately, your wealth score is not static and can go up as well as down. There are a number of ways to increase your Wealth score. 

#### Selling Items 
Adventuring may result in finding valuable items. One way to gain Wealth is selling such items. 

To sell something, you first need to determine its Value. Assuming the object is undamaged and in working condition, the sale value is equal to the object’s base Value (as if purchased new) minus 3. A damaged object may have its Value reduced by as much as 10. 

Selling an object provides equal to the amount of Wealth you would lose if you purchased an object with a Value equal to the sale Value. If you sell an item with a Value of at least 21 higher than your current Wealth, add an additional 1d6 Wealth per 10 points above 20. 

You gain a Wealth increase of at least 1 whenever you sell an object with a sale Value of 15 or higher . If you sell an object with a sale value less than or equal to your current Wealth bonus, and that sale Value is 14 or lower, you gain nothing. 

You cannot legally sell restricted objects unless you are licensed to own them, and there are usually further distribution licenses required. You also cannot legally sell objects that have been reported as stolen. Selling objects illegally usually requires that you have contacts in the black market, and reduces the sale Value by an additional 3. 

Selling an object takes a number of hours equal to the normal Value of the item.

\page

#### Working 
If you are given a job by a patron, they will likely choose to pay you directly. If so, the reward will be given a Value, and your Wealth score increases as if you sold an object of that Value. 

If your character is employed, they may be able to accumulate savings over time, which will translate to a Wealth increase. At the end of each month your character is employed, roll a d20. If the result is greater than their current Wealth, their Wealth increases by 1. For every 10 points by which you exceed your current Wealth, you gain an additional +1 to your Wealth score. Based on your job, the DM may allow you to add an appropriate ability score bonus to the check. Additionally, you may add your proficiency bonus to the check if you are proficient in a skill or tool which is appropriate to the job. For example, a history teacher may add their Intelligence or Charisma bonus to the check, and would add their proficiency bonus if they are proficient in the History skill. 

### Determining Value 
The following table puts a rough monetary range for most Value ratings players will come into contact with. Should the players encounter a value rating higher than 50, something has either gone spectacularly well or horrifyingly wrong.

### Currency Exchange 
While gold bars, silver coins, copper pieces, and solid platinum may work well as currency in a fantasy setting, they are ill-suited for a modern one. The Value system introduced in this manual abstracts the real-world complexity of wealth into an easy to understand system, however, this system doesn't convert the currency values for items and spell materials in the standard game.

For example, the spell Revivify requires the caster to provide "diamonds worth 300 gp". How many dollars do you need to spend to purchase 300 gp worth of diamonds? Using this system, the 300 gp worth of diamonds becomes $3,000 worth of diamonds, which is a value rating of 22. 

##### Currency Exchange
| DnD | Dollar Amount | 
|:------------------|:-----:|
| 1 Platinum                 | $100     | 
| 1 Gold               | $10     | 
| 1 Electrum               | $5     | 
| 1 Silver            | $1     | 
| 1 Copper           | $0.10     |

## Adventuring Gear
As elsewhere in this book, it is assumed that all adventuring gear described in the PHB and other sourcebooks still functions as described unless specifically noted otherwise. The adventuring table on the next page lists only new items applicable to a modern setting. 

Descriptions of any items that use special rules or require further explanation are listed here.
:
***Airhorn.*** A small, portable can of compressed gas used for signaling purposes. When activated, all creatures within 10 feet - including the user - must make a DC 15 constitution save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. An airhorn contains sufficient compressed gas for five uses before being expended. 

***Binoculars.*** A device consisting of two refracting telescopes mounted side-by-side and aligned to point in the same direction, allowing the viewer to use both eyes (binocular vision) when viewing distant objects. While using the binoculars, you can make out small details of creatures and objects that are 250 feet or further away, but no further than 600 feet.

***Blanket, Emergency.*** An especially low-weight, low-bulk blanket made of heat-reflective, thin, plastic sheeting meant to reflect the user's body heat. When outside of combat, an emergency blanket grants the user a +2 bonus on all constitution saving throws against cold effects. 

***Burner Phone.*** A cheap, prepaid cell phone, acquired with cash and using a SIM card not linked to any of your personal information. A burner phone can be used to communicate from a device that leaves you anonymous. When communication is complete, or when you suspect the burner account may be compromised, the burner phone can be discarded or destroyed with little financial loss. Due to their lack of features, burner phones can last for weeks on a single charge when used sparingly. 

***Compass.*** A handheld device with a magnetic needle that always points to magnetic north. When using a compass, all survival checks to determine location and direction are made with advantage. Note: this advantage only applies on Prime Material Plane locations. Magnetic north is non-existent on other planes of existence in the multiverse. 

***Computers.*** Computers are the principal devices through which characters will interact with the electronics mechanics, detailed later in this chapter. In most circumstances, a character will need to have access to a computer of some kind in order to utilize the majority of these actions. Computers come in several varieties. 
- **Desktop:** A large, powerful computer requiring external connections (monitor, keyboard, etc.) in order to gain full functionality. 
- **Laptop:** A smaller, portable computer that serves as an all-in-one device without the need for external peripherals. 
- **Tablet:** A touchscreen computer designed for maximum portability.
- **Smartphone:** Ostensibly a cell phone first, modern smartphones feature internet connectivity and surprisingly powerful processing power. Ubiquitous, concealable, and versatile.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::

***Fake ID.*** A forged identification card or other official document. Fake IDs range from relatively simple fabricated driver's licenses to more intricate false passports. A player can utilize a forgery kit to make their own fake ID as opposed to purchasing one. In either case, the DC of a fake ID is 8 + the forger's proficiency bonus. An opposed check using a creature's perception skill can spot a fake ID. 

***Fire Extinguisher.*** A cannister containing a compressed chemical agent for use in suppressing and extinguishing small fires. It cannot be used to combat large, raging fires but is useful for containing  smaller blazes. When used against a creature, a fire extinguisher sprays its contents in a 15-ft cone. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 constitution save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. 

***Flashlight*** An electrical light source that runs for approximately five hours on a battery charge. A flashlight produces bright light in a cone up to 100 ft from the point of origin.  

***Gas Mask.*** A specialized filtered breathing device meant to protect against poison gases. When worn, a gas mask grants immunity against any toxic gases that inflict poison damage, up to a certain point as determined by the DM.

}}
}}


Note that some sources of toxic damage (such as a dragon's breath weapon) may be caustic beyond the ability of a gas mask to protect against, requiring full body protection. A gas mask is only suitable protection against ambient toxicity that would be dangerous to inhale, not that which can cause damage upon physical contact with the skin. 

***Ghillie Suit.*** A full-body concealment suit consisting of netting covered in cloth and burlap, meant to break up the wearer's profile . While worn, a ghillie suit provides a +4 bonus to stealth checks made within a comparable natural environment matching the tones of the suit (i.e. a desert-patterned suit will not confer this bonus in a wooded environment). With a successful DC 15 survival check and one hour preparation time, a ghillie suit can be supplemented with flora from the surrounding area, conferring an additional +1 bonus on stealth checks. Due to the bulk of the suit, a -1 DEX penalty is conferred on the user.

***Glowsticks.*** Small, plastic tubes containing a chemiluminescent fluid. When activated, a glowstick provides dim light in a 30 ft radius for 8 hours. 

***GPS, handheld.*** An electronic device that uses satellite signals to track the position of the device. Unless the satellite signal is blocked, the user of a GPS will always be able to determine their location on a Prime Material Plane world. Like a compass, a GPS unit will confer no benefits on other planes of existence. 

***Holster, Concealed*** A holster for a firearm designed to conceal the weapon from view. Concealed holsters are often designed to be located on the hip, armpit, small of the back, or the ankle. A weapon carried in a concealed holster gives a +2 bonus to sleight of hand checks made to conceal that weapon. Only weapons with both the "light" and "one-handed" properties may be carried in a concealed holster. 

***Goggles, Nightvision.*** A set of nightvision goggles (NVGs) amplifies ambient, low-level light into the visible range. A creature wearing a set of NVGs is treated as having darkvision up to 120 feet. Due to the amplification properties of NVGs, any sufficiently bright source of sudden light (such as the *Dancing Lights* cantrip) will blind the user for as long as the NVGs are worn, or until the light source is dismissed. 

***Magazine, Box.*** A plastic or metal spring-loaded box for feeding ammunition into a weapon's action. Loading a magazine with loose ammunition takes approximately 12 seconds for every 10 rounds of ammunition. Magazines can be loaded with any number of rounds up to their maximum capacity, as determined by the type of weapon. 

Note that the firearms table outlines the capacity of a magazine for a given weapon. Box magazines are not interchangeable between weapon types (i.e. a pistol with a 15 round magazine cannot utilize a 30-round magazine meant for an automatic rifle). 

***Magazine, Belt Links.*** A belt magazine is not so much a single item but rather a collection of interlinked individual rounds of ammunition. While a complete belt can be purchased in accordance with the cost of ammunition types detailed later in this section, the belt links described here can be used to combine loose ammunition into a connected belt. Creating a belt using loose ammunition and belt links takes 10 minutes per 100-round belt.

Belts can be combined or broken to any length. Two 100- round belts can be connected to create a 200-round belt. Likewise, a 100-round belt can be split to create (for example) one 40- bullet 
belt and one 60-round belt. Connecting or splitting a belt is a move action.

***Pepper Spray.*** A compact cylinder of compressed inflammatory agent used as an incapacitating defense weapon. Pepper spray is an extremely short-range weapon and can only be used against adjacent creatures. Creatures targeted with pepper spray must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. A can of pepper spray contains enough charge for one use and is then rendered empty.

***Signal Flare.*** A chemical pyrotechnic device used for signaling or illumination. When activated, a signal flare burns for 3 minutes, and cannot be extinguished with water. It provides bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20. When used as part of a melee attack, it inflicts 1d4 fire damage on a hit.

***Sling, Rifle.*** A rifle sling is a length of nylon fabric connected to a firearm at one or more points, allowing the user to carry an otherwise cumbersome weapon without the use of their hands. A rifle sling can be affixed to any two-handed firearm that does not have the "heavy" property, and can then be released or picked up as a free action. A character may only carry one "slung" weapon at a time. 

***Two-Way Radio*** A radio device that allows for two-way (send/receive) communication over an agreed-upon signal frequency. A two-way radio can be used to keep in constant contact with other individuals without the use of a cellular network or internet connection. Without encryption, however, eavesdropping on a signal frequency is possible, and range is often measured in only a handful of miles at best. 

## Armor and Shields

Armor in the DnD setting has been expanded by, rather than replaced with, the advent of modern ballistic armor. For expansive coverage against bladed instruments, a set of plate mail is still king, and bladed instruments are still plenty popular. To keep pace with the changing nature of armed conflict, even relatively traditional armor smiths may add a layer of ballistic material as a lining to their otherwise archaic breastplates, greaves, and pauldrons. The armor and shields in this section are intended to expand upon the armors already offered in the PHB by offering additional options for something more aesthetically appropriate for newly introduced player options. 

There are two basic varieties of modern armor: "soft" armor which consists of densely woven heavy fabrics, 

\column

and "hard" armor which is generally a steel or ceramic plate designed to be worn over vital areas. Various combinations of these two armor types are divided into three armor categories: Light, Medium, and Heavy. 

### Light Armor 
Light armor places emphasis on concealability and freedom of movement as opposed to soaking up repeated impacts. Armors in this category consist of "soft" armor fabrics and panels. 

***Leather Jacket.*** A heavy leather biker's jacket offering some protection against comparatively minor impacts and abrasions. 

***Undercover Vest.*** Designed for undercover work in which it is critical that the wearer not appear to be armed or armored. Very thin compared to other armor options, the undercover vest relies primarily on sewn Kevlar panels to defend against relatively low-velocity handgun rounds. 

### Medium Armor 
Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, at the cost of some maneuverability. At this level, some degree of hard armor plating is often added to supplement protective fibers.

***Patrol Vest.*** Similar in design to the undercover vest, the bulletproof vest is bulkier, using thicker Kevlar panels. 

***Soft Panel Vest.*** Once again similar in philosophy of design to the undercover and patrol vest, the soft panel relies on armor panels inserted into pockets in the vest for protection. The "soft armor" panels used in this vest are essentially super-thick layers of woven Kevlar, protecting against higher velocity and larger handgun rounds. 

***Tactical Vest.*** The standard body armor for police tactical units. This vest provides full-torso protection in the toughest flexible protective materials available as well as a front-facing "trauma plate" of either steel or ceramic. Multiple pouches for equipment such as magazines, radios, and medical equipment are integrated into the design.

### Heavy Armor 
Heavy armor emphasizes the ability to take a hit and stay in the fight. Armors in this category feature one or more thick ballistic plates rated to sustain multiple hits

}}

from rifle-caliber firearms without compromising their durability. 

***Plate Carrier.*** A modern, comparatively minimalist, body armor consisting of a front and back panel pocket housing thick ceramic ballistic plates. Velcro accessory panels cover the front and back, allowing the wearer to affix a variety of pouches and carriers for different missions.

***Modular Tactical Vest.*** A heavy canvas cuirass jacket with ceramic plates over the chest and back, secured around the waist by a velcro "cummerbund" belt. The belt itself also houses smaller ceramic plates to protect from bullet impacts from the side.

***Combat Armor.*** A full set of modern combat armor utilizing not just a full plate vest, but also hard armor around the neck and a set of soft armor pauldrons over the shoulders. Soft armor panels sewn into an outer layer leg guard provide additional protection to the lower body. A ballistic helmet completes the set. 

### Shields 
A shield is made of a durable protective material and carried in one hand. You can benefit from only one shield at a time. 

***Makeshift Shield.*** A makeshift shield is an impromptu shield either found or rapidly crafted. Each time you are hit with an attack, roll a d20. On a 10 or lower the makeshift shield breaks or is damaged beyond use. 

***Riot Shield.*** A lightweight protective device deployed by police and military organizations.

## Weapons

Modern firearms are ubiquitous in contemporary conflict. Range, versatility, and a training foundation measured in hours or days rather than years means that the firearm has become the weapon of choice for most individuals expecting trouble. In a world of heroes, however, the sword and spear are not simply relics of the past, but compete side by side (and toe to toe) with infantry rifles and personal defense weapons. In this new world, most character classes are assumed to have at least passing familiarity with firearms, much in the same way those in the core rulebooks are assumed to have knowledge of other weapons. Thus, firearms fit into the existing simple and martial ranged category, and characters are granted firearms proficiency according to their existing PHB weapons proficiency.  

### Weapon Properties
Many firearms have special properties related to their use, as shown in the firearms table.

***Ammunition*** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition (unless otherwise specified). The ammunition for firearms is destroyed upon use. If you use a firearm to make a melee attack instead, you treat the firearm as an improvised weapon. Ammunition is specific to each firearm, unless the firearms have the same type of damage dice. For example, ammunition can be exchanged between a pistol (d6) and a submachine gun (d6), but not a sniper rifle (d12).

Ammunition comes in a variety of calibers, with different cost and weight depending upon the damage die. Both the cost and weight are given for 100 rounds. 

##### Ammunition
| Damage Die |    Value    | Weight |
|:-----|:----------:|:-----------------:|
| 1d4                 | 5     | 1 lb                |
| 1d6               |   8   | 1.5 lb                |
| 1d8               |   8   | 1 lb                |
| 1d10             |    8  | 2 lb                |
| 1d12             |    11  | 2.5 lb                |
| 2d6           |  12    | 6 lb                |
| 2d8           |  14    | 9 lb                |

***Auto.*** Weapons with this property can utilize the burst and suppressive fire features described in this section. Light and Heavy Machine Guns can *only* attack with burst and suppressive attacks and cannot target a creature with only a single round of ammunition.

***Burst.*** Weapons with this property may make a burst attack as described in this section but expend fewer rounds of ammunition on the attack than the default 5. The rounds expended are listed in parentheses. 

***Covert.*** You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to conceal this weapon. 

***Finesse.*** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

***Heavy.*** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively. A Tiny creature is unable to use a heavy weapon at all. 

***Light.*** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9 of the PHB.

***Range.*** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the range property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond the normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range. 

***Reach.*** Weapons with the reach property extend your weapons reach by 5 feet when you attack with it. 

***Reload.*** You can fire a certain number of shots with this weapon before it must be reloaded. Modern firearms feed from either an external or internal magazine. The type of magazine used determines the speed of the reload action as follows:

- **Box:** an external magazine which can be swapped out quickly for fast reloads. Reloading a weapon with a box magazine is a bonus action. 
- **Internal:** internal magazines are built into the weapon itself, requiring ammunition to be reloaded one round at a time. Reloading an internal magazine is an action. 
- **Belt:** machine guns feed from a linked belt of ammunition, allowing for longer continuous fire. Reloading a belt-fed weapon requires opening the weapon, removing the expended belt box, attaching a new box, and inserting the end of the new belt in the mechanism. Due to the complexity of the reloading action, reloading a belt-fed weapon requires both an action *and* a bonus action used in tandem. 

***Special.*** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons").

***Spread*** Some firearms - namely shotguns - fire ammunition that is not a single solid bullet, but rather a number of small pellets (referred to as "shot"). This shot spreads into an irregular pattern over range. When you attack with a spread weapon, if the attack is made at long range you may apply your attack roll to a second creature within 5 feet of your original target. Damage is rolled separately for each creature, but each creature takes half damage from their respective roll. 

***Thrown.*** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.

\column

 {{width:10px}} ***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses indicates the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

{{note
##### Variant Rule: Weapon Damage
As mentioned in the introduction to this book, firearm damage is designed by default to match a pulpy tone, wherein firearms and archaic melee weapons are intended to be of a match for each other. This is in service of making the game more fun, and allowing characters the freedom to choose whether they want to play a greatsword wielding barbarian or a "high speed low drag" special forces operator. 

If, however, the image of an antimateriel rifle doing only slightly more damage than that of a very pointy stick is just too disruptive to your sense of verisimilitude, then you may opt to increase the default damage of the firearms as presented. Simply add an extra damage die to each firearm (i.e. 1d6 > 2d6, 2d8 > 3d8, etc.) in order to run a game with more lethal firearms.

#### Special Weapons 
This section describes weapons that have special rules or require further explanation. 

***Baton, Stun.*** A metal rod with an electrified stun gun at one end. A stun baton has 5 charges. When you hit a creature with a stun baton, you may expend one charge. The target must make a DC 10 constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the start of your next turn. Once charges are expended, the stun baton can be recharged over a period of six hours, providing you have access to electricity.   

***Chainsaw.*** A chainsaw must be running to be used to its full effect, otherwise it is considered an improvised weapon. Starting a chainsaw requires a bonus action. If you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll with a chainsaw it is stalled until restarted.

***Flamethrower.*** A flamethrower consists of a pressurized backpack containing fuel, connected to a rifle-like tube with a pilot light at the muzzle. When the trigger is pulled, the flamethrower ejects a portion of the pressurized fuel which is ignited by the pilot light, projecting a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line of flame. Any creature caught in the path of this attack can attempt a DC 13 dexterity saving throw to take half damage. 
Any creature that does not succeed on the save takes full damage and also catches on fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each subsequent round until the flames are extinguished. A burning creature can be doused as an action. 

A flamethrower has sufficient fuel for 10 "shots" at which point the tank is depleted. Refilling or replacing a fuel tank requires a second tank (purchase value 13) and takes 1 minute.

The fuel backpacks pose a potential risk to the operator, however. A flamethrower tank can be targeted by opponents. It has an AC of 17 and 20 hitpoints and is considered to have three quarters cover unless the attack is made from behind 

\column

the creature wielding the flamethrower. When reduced to 0 hitpoints, the fuel tank explodes, causing 6d6 fire damage to all creatures within a 10 foot radius and sets them on fire. Creatures can make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw for half damage and to avoid being caught on fire. The wielder of the flamethrower cannot attempt this save. 

***Machine Gun, Heavy.*** The recoil of this weapon is difficult to control. Without securing the weapon on a bipod, tripod, or other stabilizing mount, attack rolls with this weapon are made with disadvantage. A creature with a Strength of 12 or lower firing this weapon without a stabilizing mount must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. Deploying a mount/affixing a weapon to an available mount is a bonus action.  

***Grenade Launcher.*** This weapon allows you to propel a fragmentation, smoke, or gas grenade up to 120 feet away. You can directly target a creature within 40 feet using a grenade launcher. On a hit you deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage to that creature, and then the grenade effect occurs.

***Pistol, Pocket.*** Pocket pistols are small caliber easily concealable pistols often used as a backup or deep concealment weapon. Due to their small caliber, pocket pistols can be more effectively suppressed, operating as “silent” weapons which require a DC 15 perception check to detect their firing. See additional rules under “Noise” in the Firearms section. 

***Sword Cane.*** A thin, lightweight blade hidden within the shaft of a cane, walking stick, or umbrella. While sheathed, a sword cane is considered concealed, requiring no sleight of hand check. A static DC 18 perception check is required to spot that the cane is in fact a weapon. Unsheathing the blade is a free action. If used without unsheathing, the sword cane deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage instead.

### Rules for Firearms 

Supplemental rules specific to firearms and their use are described in this section.  

#### Burst
Automatic weapons, and those with a specified “burst” rate of fire can make a burst fire attack. Targeted creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw **(DC = 8 + your attack bonus)**. If the attack is made within long range, targeted creatures have advantage on the save. If the creature makes a successful save, no damage is taken. 

On a successful hit, add an additional damage die to your damage roll (i.e. a 1d8 assault rifle deals 2d8 damage). 

Burst fire expends 5 rounds unless the burst setting of the weapon specifies fewer. 

#### Suppressing Fire
Suppressing Fire is when a combatant saturates a target area with fire, rather than an individual target. This allows teammates a chance to move or act without being targeted by the enemy.

The combatant first designates a target area within the weapon’s normal range. The target area is a line or a series of adjacent spaces up to the size of the allowed target area, as indicated in the following table: 

##### Suppressing Fire 
| Fire Mode | Target Size | Rounds Required |
|:------------------|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Semi-Auto                 | 10 ft     | 8               |
| Automatic               | 30 ft     | 20               |
\column

Any targets in or between the shooter and the targeted area are subject to the Suppressive Fire effects. (If using a map, you can draw a line from the right and left ends of the area targeted back to the shooter. Any space with the center of the space within the area is affected.) This is called the Field of Fire.

Anyone in the Field of Fire, who is not behind effective total cover will be hit. There is no attack roll, and no critical hits are possible. Combatants in the Field of Fire can use the Dive for Cover reaction (detailed in this section) to avoid the damage but must decide to do so before damage is rolled. The shooter rolls damage once for all targets.

The Field of Fire remains until the beginning of your next turn, until you move, until you are moved by someone else, or until you suffer a condition that stops you from firing; whichever comes first. Anyone entering the Field of Fire, or coming out of total cover within it, while it is in effect will take damage automatically.

#### Dive for cover: 
When a combatant is about to take damage from an area effect such as an explosion or Suppressing Fire, they can use their reaction to *Dive for Cover* and avoid the damage.

When diving for cover, combatants try to get out of the area of effect, leave the field of fire, or get behind full cover that can completely block the attack. Here is how that works:

Combatants may move up to half their speed to the nearest safe space or location:
- Behind total cover capable of blocking the effect
- Out of the field of fire (see Suppressive Fire for details)
- Outside the area of effect

Normal movement rules apply to this Movement. If they can reach a qualifying location then they avoid all damage and effects, and fall prone at the end of their movement, if not already prone. 

If a targeted creature cannot reach a qualifying location then there is generally no reason to attempt the reaction, unless the movement is advantageous to them for other reasons. They are nonetheless still allowed the  
 {{width:10px}} movement and can use their reaction if they wish.  
  {{width:30px}} They suffer all specified damage and effects and  
   {{width:50px}} also fall prone at the end of their movement, if  
    {{width:60px}} not already prone.

#### Noise 
No two ways about it: guns are loud. A character using a firearm must be careful when choosing to use it as the report of gunfire can potentially alert enemies or authorities. Many variables come into play when determining how well a firearm can be heard, such as distance, the environment, and surrounding noise levels. It is at the DM’s discretion how well the noise of a firearm is perceived. However, there are ways to reduce the noise of these weapons. 

***Suppressors.*** A suppressor fits on the end of a firearm. capturing the gasses traveling at supersonic speed that propel a bullet as it is fired. This dramatically reduces the sound the weapon makes when it is used. Suppressed weapons fired from stealth do not break stealth automatically; rather opponents must still succeed on a Perception check vs. a creature's stealth check in order to locate the source of the gunfire. This check is made with a +2 bonus.

A firearm that deals 1d4 points of damage or less operates entirely silently when used with a suppressor, and requires a DC 15 perception check to notice the sound at all. 

A suppressor reduces a weapon’s  
damage.  For firearms that normally deal  
1d6 points of damage, silencing imposes a –1 penalty on damage rolls. For firearms that normally deal 1d8, 1d10, or 1d12 points of damage, silencing imposes a –2 penalty on damage rolls. Weapons that normally deal 2d6 points of damage or more cannot be silenced. Firearms that deal 1d4 points of damage are unaffected.

#### Special Ammunition 
Certain ammunition can be purchased or modified to create special ammunition. Special ammunition is available at a DM's discretion. Special ammunition, unless otherwise stated, costs 50% more than its non-special counterpart. 

***Breaching.*** Designed to destroy deadbolts, locks, or door hinges, this ammunition deals double damage to doors and others objects/structures. Breaching rounds are exclusive to shotguns. 

***Hollow Point.*** This ammunition deals an extra 1d4 bludgeoning damage to any unarmored creature or object it hits. Due to the reduction in penetration power of hollow point bullets, any creature wearing armor ignores the typical piercing damage the weapon would confer and takes *only* the 1d4 bludgeoning damage, as the hollow point round is assumed to not penetrate the armor. Firearms dealing 2d6 or 2d8 damage cannot use hollow point ammunition. 

***Dragon's Breath.*** Originally intended as a signaling device as opposed to an offensive weapon, a Dragon's Breath round fires magnesium shards over a short distance, which burn intensely hot and bright. These rounds are restricted to shotguns, and have a maximum range of 30 feet, regardless of the short/long range stats of the shotgun itself. Any creature hit by the blast takes 1d6 fire damage and is set on fire, burning for an extra 1d6 fire damage each subsequent round until the fire is extinguished as an action. 

***Silvered Ammunition.*** You can silver ten pieces of ammunition for $500 (16 value rating). This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the ammunition without making it less effective. 

***Nonlethal Rounds.*** Nonlethal rounds such as rubber bullets for conventional rifled firearms and beanbag rounds for shotguns, are designed as less-lethal riot control munitions. Instead of dealing piercing damage, nonlethal rounds instead deal bludgeoning damage and creatures take half damage from any damage roll. These rounds allow for non-lethal damage to be dealt with a ranged weapon instead of a melee weapon. This damage otherwise follows the same rules as described on Pg. 198 of the PHB.
::::::::::
{{note
##### Variant Rule: Caliber Compatibility
For simplicity, the firearms in this section are designed such that any two weapons sharing the same damage die can share ammunition. This is meant to simplify the tedium of tracking wildly variable ammunition. If desired, however, play groups may opt to track specific ammunition and magazine types with greater granularity than simply "pistol ammunition" and "box magazine". 

Using this ruleset, a 9mm Beretta 92FS would not be able to use the .45 ACP ammunition of a Colt M1911, even though both deal 1d6 damage. Similarly, the NATO standard STANAG magazines of an M16A4 or L85A2 would not be compatible with the Steyr AUG A1, which uses a proprietary magazine, even though all three rifles are chambered in 5.56x45 (1d8). 

If that made sense to you, then you are this writer's kind of weird. However, this degree of "realism" is not for everyone, and can just as easily cause confusion and get your group bogged down in needless administrative recordkeeping of who is carrying what ammunition. Choose the playstyle that is right for you and your group. 
}}

## Explosives
Modern explosives contain a variety of refined trigger and delivery mechanisms for inflicting "boom" on your chosen target. Broadly speaking, explosives come in two varieties: thrown **grenades** and stationary **planted explosives**. Not every type of explosive is available in both varieties, and a character must choose which delivery device they are buying when purchasing explosive equipment.

### Grenades
Grenades are handheld thrown explosives that can be used to target an area of effect at range. As an action, a creature can arm and throw a grenade at a targeted square. A grenade can be thrown up to a maximum range of 30 feet + (your Strength modifier x 5). Grenade launchers can propel a grenade greater distances, depending upon the launcher used, but up to 120 feet by default. The targeted location must be within range, and there must be a clear path to the space. It is possible to throw a grenade at a space that is behind an obstacle so long as the explosive can reasonably be thrown over (or through) that obstacle. You add your Dexterity modifier to any attack roll made with a grenade thrown by hand. The difficulty of the throw determines the DC. 

##### Grenade Targeting
| Target Barrier | DC | 
|:------------------|:-----:|
| No barrier                | 10    | 
| Short wall              | 12     | 
| Large opening (door, picture window)               | 14     | 
| Small opening (car window, air vent)           | 18     | 

If the attacker cannot see the location, the attack has disadvantage. If the attacker misses, the grenade will still explode, making grenades potentially hazardous weapons as they do not distinguish between friend and foe, and a poor throw can place your allies in the blast radius. If you fail on your attack roll, roll a d6 and consult the following table: 

##### Grenade Miss
| d6 | Result | 
|:------------------|:-----:|
| 1-2                 | Falls short    | 
| 3              | Miss Left     | 
| 4               | Miss Right     | 
| 5-6            | Overshoot     | 

Second, roll a d4 and multiply the result by 5 ft. This is how far the grenade rolls before detonating. On a roll of natural 1, the grenade does not detonate at all, and is considered a dud. 

\column

{{note
##### Grenade Attack Example
Bruenor is facing three goblins hiding behind a stone wall. Rather than engage them directly behind cover, he chooses to throw a fragmentation grenade over the wall. He makes an attack roll of d20 + DEX and gets an 8, meaning he misses the targeted square. 

He then rolls a d6 and gets a 3, meaning the grenade missed to the left of the targeted square. He rolls a d4 and gets a 2, and multiplies that result by 5 to get 10. The DM marks a space 10 ft (2 squares) to the left of the targeted square as the position at which the grenade detonates. 
}}

Grenades detonate at the end of the attacker's turn. Targeted creatures may attempt to avoid the damage by using the Dive for Cover reaction, or attempt a saving throw as indicated to halve the damage or negate the effects.

### Planted Explosives 
Planted explosives are strategically placed devices often employed in perimeter defense or ambush tactics. As an action, a character can prime and place an explosive in a location and it will explode when the detonator is triggered. With a stealth check and five minutes of preparation time, you can conceal a planted explosive, making it more difficult to detect without specialized equipment. The original stealth check for the hidden explosive is opposed by a creature's passive perception check when a creature moves within 15 feet of the explosive. Several different kinds of triggering devices exist for different needs. 

***Detonator, Radio.*** A detonator that uses a signal from a specific radio frequency to trigger the detonation. As an action, a creature can detonate a planted explosive with a radio detonator provided it is no more than half a mile away.  

***Detonator, Wired*** The simplest available detonator device, a wired detonator is physically connected to the explosive by a cord with a manual trigger at the end. Each wired detonator includes 500 ft of wire, and can be detonated as an action. 

***Timer*** When planting an explosive with a timer, a creature determines the number of rounds or minutes for the countdown, up to a maximum of 1 hour. When the countdown ends, the explosive is detonated. 

***Trigger, Pressure*** A pressure trigger is essentially a spring mechanism set to a certain weight threshold. When a weight greater than the threshold is applied to the mechanism - such as a creature stepping on it or a vehicle driving over it - the trigger is activated and the explosive detonates. 

***Trigger, proximity*** A proximity trigger uses advanced motion, sound, and vibration sensors to determine when a creature enters the kill zone. When one or more creatures enters its burst radius, it automatically detonates. 

Due to the near-instantaneous detonation when a trigger device is activated, creatures are not able to use 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote CHAPTER 6 | GEAR}}
\page

the Dive for Cover reaction to avoid the damage; creatures instead can attempt a saving throw as indicated by the explosive type to take half damage or negate the effects of the explosive. 

### Types of Explosives 
While the typical imagining of an explosive device is a dramatic fireball, in reality the "explosive" element of any explosive device is simply the dispersal mechanism; an explosion projects any number of ordnance types outward with tremendous force, though that ordnance may not itself be fire and force. Descriptions of various kinds of explosive ordnance and their properties can be found below. 

#### Flashbang
*Grenade*  ::

A flashbang is a non-lethal explosive device used to temporarily disorient an enemy's senses. It is designed to produce a blinding "flash" of light and an intensely loud "bang" without causing permanent injury. 

**Radius:** :: 15 ft
**Damage:**        :: --
**Save:**   :: DC 13 CON (no effect)
**Value:** :: 7

#### Fragmentation
*Grenade/Planted* ::

These explosives are designed to disperse lethal fragments on detonation. The body is generally made of a hard synthetic material or steel, which then acts as shrapnel when the explosive detonates. Thrown explosives are typically spherical in shape, whereas planted explosives are shaped as hard plastic boxes that will disperse shrapnel outwards in a directed cone pattern, effective for area denial applications. 

**Radius:** :: 15 ft (grenade) / 15 ft cone (planted)
**Damage:**        :: 4d6 slashing
**Save:**   :: DC 13 DEX (half damage) 
**Value:** :: 8

#### Incendiary
*Grenade*  ::

Incendiary devices use volatile chemicals such as phosphorous, thermite, or napalm to produce a burning effect. More often used for destroying equipment in the field, incendiary grenades can be used offensively as well. When targeted by an incendiary grenade attack, a creature can make the indicated save for half damage. On a failed save, the creature takes full damage and also burns for 1d4 rounds. At the beginning of each of its turns, the target takes 1d6 fire damage, and it can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames. The blast radius of an incendiary grenade leaves behind a burning residue that burns for 1d4 rounds. Any creature entering this zone while it is burning also catches fire. 

**Radius:** :: 10 ft
**Damage:**        :: 2d6
**Save:**   :: DC 13 DEX (half damage)
**Value:** :: 8

#### Plastic Explosive
*Planted*  ::

Plastic explosive is a soft and hand-moldable solid form of explosive material. While the statistics given are for one pound of explosive, it can easily be cut, formed, wrapped, and combined with others of its type. Each additional pound of plastic explosive combined with the original device adds 2d6 points of damage to the explosion and expands the radius by 5 feet, up to a maximum of 10d6 and 25 ft. Plastic explosives are especially suited for explosive demolition of obstacles and fortifications, and as such deal double damage to structures and objects. 

**Radius:** :: 10 ft (+5 ft/additional lb, max 25)
**Damage:**        :: 4d6 (+ 2d6/additional lb, max 10d6)
**Save:**   :: DC 13 DEX (half damage)
**Value:** :: 9


#### Smoke
*Grenade*  ::

Smoke grenades are used as ground-to-ground or ground-to-air signaling devices, target or landing zone marking devices, and to create a smoke-screen for concealment. When buying a smoke grenade you may also choose the color of the smoke. When deployed, a smoke grenade emits a cloud of smoke with an effect similar to that of a *Fog Cloud* spell. The smoke creates a heavily obscured area in a 20-foot radius. It disperses after 1 minute, though a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.

**Radius:** :: 20 ft
**Damage:**        :: ---
**Save:**   :: None
**Value:** :: 5


#### Tear Gas
*Grenade*  ::

A composition of explosive and aerosolized CS gas, tear gas works by irritating mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs, and causes crying, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing, pain in the eyes, and temporary blindness. When deployed, the grenade emits a cloud of tear gas that creates a heavily obscured area in a 20-foot radius. It disperses after 1 minute, though a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4
rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round. 

Any creature starting its turn in the gas is considered blinded and must succeed on the indicated saving throw

### Disarming an Explosive
Using an action, a character can try to disable a planted explosive by making a Dexterity check. If the character is also proficient with the engineering kit, it can add its proficiency bonus to the check if it has the kit at hand. The DC for disarming an explosive varies depending on different factors, which are shown in the table below.

##### Disarming Explosives
| Factor | DC | 
|:------------------|:-----:|
| Detonator type is unknown                 | 18    | 
| Detonator type is known              | 12     | 
| Explosive was set by a creature with the Sapper feat.               | + half the proficiency bonus of the creature who planted the device     | 


A character can try to determine the detonator type from a
safe distance making a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

On a successful disarm check, the detonator is destroyed, the explosive is safely deactivated and it can be recovered for later use. If a character succeeds the 
\column
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

check by 5 or more, the detonator can be recovered too. On a failure, the DC of subsequent checks increases by +2. After three failed checks, or if any single check fails by 5 or more, the device is detonated.

# Chapter 7: Electronics

Most characters in a modern campaign setting  are well versed in using computers, and are  automatically successful when employing technology for mundane tasks (searching a hard  drive or the Internet, using the normal functions  of an electronic device, and so on). For especially  challenging technological tasks (finding hidden  information on a computer, restoring  information from a device that’s been erased,  and so on), a character makes an Intelligence  check against a DC set by the DM. However,  some technical tasks—including breaking into  protected computer systems, accessing hidden  functions of electronic devices, or using a device  in a way it was not designed for—require the use  of specialized hacking tools, detailed in the Equipment Section. 

### Tech Categories 
At the DM’s discretion, all electronic devices fall into one or more of the following categories: 

***Functional.*** Electronics built to serve mostly  
one purpose: Lights, stereos, calculators, lawn  
mowers, etc. 

***Communication.*** Electronics built for  
purposes of communicating over distance:  
Phones, radio, bluetooth, wi-fi, networks, etc.

***Monitoring.*** Electronics built for  
surveillance and security purposes: Security  
cameras, motion sensors, GPS, card readers, fingerprint scanners, etc. 

***Storage.*** Electronics built for the purpose  
of storing information: Hard drives, flash  
drives, floppy disks, etc.

### Bypass Device Security 
Most electronic devices are protected by  
a security program intended to defend  
the device from being hacked. A character  
can make an Intelligence check to  
attempt to disable the security system  
to gain access to the device. The  
character may add their proficiency  
bonus to this check if they use hacking  
tools and are proficient with them. 

The DC for this check is determined  
by the quality of the security program  
installed, as shown in the table below. 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote CHAPTER 7 | ELECTRONICS}}
\page

| Security Level | DC | 
|:-----------|:-----:|
| Minimum                 | 15     | +2 |
| Average               | 20     | +2   |
| Exceptional               | 25     | +2  |
| Maximum            | 30     | +2  |

If the check is failed, make a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the system does not trigger an alarm or trap, and the character can make another attempt to bypass the device's security system. On a failure, the device's security system triggers a warning or trap (if any), and the character loses access to the device and can not attempt to bypass its security program again for 24 hours. 

### Degrade Programming 
A character can try to destroy or alter applications on an electronic device to make use of that device harder or impossible. There are three possible actions related to this:
 
***Crashing a Device.*** This simply shuts down the device. It’s possible to restart the device in 1 minute without making a skill check. 

***Damage Programming.*** This imposes disadvantage on all Intelligence checks made with the device until its repaired. 

***Destroy Programming.*** This make the device unusable until the programming is repaired. 

##### Degrade Programming
| Action | DC | Time |
|:------------------|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Crash Device                 | 10     | 1 minute                |
| Damage Programming               | 15     | 10 minutes                |
| Destroy Programming               | 20     | 10 minutes               |

This process requires your concentration. If your concentration is broken, the attempt fails and the application or electronic device is not altered or destroyed. 

### File Search 
Whenever a character is using an electronic device such as a computer, smartphone or tablet to find files or data in an unfamiliar network it can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. The DC and the time for finding a file vary depending on the size of the network, as shown in the table below. 

| Network Size | DC | Time |
|:------------------|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Personal Computer                 | 10     | 1 round                |
| Small Office Network              | 15     | 2 rounds                |
| Large Office Network               | 20     | 1 minute              |
| Massive Corporation Network               | 25     | 10 minutes               |

If the character succeeds on the check, the file is found. On a failure, the file is not found and it must make another check to search it again. After 1 failed attempt, the character has 1d4 more failed attempts before the security system denies them further access the system.

### Operate Remote Device 
If a character has access to a controller that operates a remote device, it can either shut them off or change their operating parameters. The DC depends on the nature of the operation. 
:::
##### Operate Remote Device
| Type of Operation| DC | Time |
|:----------------|:-----:|:--------------------:|
| Shut down a passive remote device (including cameras and door locks) | 20     | 1 round                |
| Shut down an active remote device (including motion detectors and alarms)| 25     | 2 rounds |
| Reset the remote device parameters | 25     | 1 minute              |
| Change remote device passcodes   | 25     | 1 minute               |

If the check is failed, make a DC 25 Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the system does not trigger an alarm or trap, and the character can make another attempt to operate the remote device. On a failure, the device's security system triggers a warning or trap (if any), and the character loses access to the device and cannot attempt to operate it again for 24 hours. 

### Additional Hacking Actions 
There are two additional actions you can make to hack into a site: 

***Covering Tracks***. Spending 1 minute, you can make an Intelligence check (DC 20) using the hacking tools to alter your identifying information. Doing this imposes disadvantage to the Intelligence check made by the administrator to identify you. 

***Accessing Through Internet.*** If you are not able to access the device physically, you must find the address making an Intelligence (Investigation) check first, and then defeat the device security (if any). The DC for the Intelligence (Investigation) check is determined by the DM.

# Chapter 8: Vehicles

A sports car tears down a stretch of highway, its engine emitting a throaty roar. Just behind follows a powerful SUV with tinted windows. A combatant leans out of the passenger side window of the SUV and braces a rifle against the side mirror. A shot shatters the rear glass of the sports car before a return shot punctures the SUV's front tire, causing it to nose sharply to the left before flipping over and exploding into a vicious fireball. 

It's the kind of scene you've witnessed countless times, and for which the pseudo-medeival rules of base DnD do not account well for. In this chapter are vehicle properties and rules for chase sequences and combat that DMs can utilize to emulate high-speed vehicle antics. 

## Vehicle Properties
Vehicles behave in a way similar to animal mounts, but do not act independently, do not have an initiative score, and have no actions of their own. A vehicle requires an operator in order to function, and that operator can use their actions to control the vehicle, using the vehicles stats for actions performed with the vehicle as appropriate. 

### Vehicle Proficiency
A creature with proficiency in land, water, or air vehicles may add their proficiency bonus to skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws made while controlling a vehicle of the corresponding type. If any conditions would impact the vehicle operator's checks normally (such as being blinded or suffering a similar condition), the vehicle checks are also affected. 

### Entering and Exiting Vehicles
Once during your turn, you can enter an unlocked vehicle that is within five feet of you. Doing so costs half your movement speed. Exiting the vehicle is performed under the same conditions.

### Exiting a Moving Vehicle 
A driver can choose to have a vehicle they control continue its movement in a straight line immediately before jumping from the vehicle. To jump from the vehicle, a creature must make a DC 13 Acrobatics check. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle will continue to move that turn. On a successful save, no damage is taken. Regardless of the success or failure of the save, the creature falls prone immediately following this action. 

### Vehicle Cover
Occupants of a vehicle are typically assumed to have half cover from attacks made against them while inside the vehicle. This can vary depending upon the type of vehicle, actions taken by the characters, or the type of attack. For example, a motorcycle confers no cover to its occupants, while an armored car or APC will often grant total cover. That cover can be negated by characters opening doors or hatches, exposing them to attack, or if the source of an attack should originate within the vehicle (such as an expertly-thrown grenade). 

### Opportunity Attacks 
Vehicles provoke opportunity attacks as normal. When a vehicle provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote CHAPTER 8 | VEHICLES}}
\page

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/pxe4xdx.png' style='position:absolute;Bottom:0px;Right:0px;width:800px;mix-blend-mode:multiply'/>

can target the vehicle or any creature riding on or inside it that doesn’t have total cover and is within reach.

### Skills
While relatively simple vehicle operation checks will typically utilize a vehicle's dexterity score (and their proficiency bonus, if applicable), there may be situations in which more precise skills may be more appropriate for the check. Below are some examples of skill checks and their use as it relates to operating a vehicle

- **Acrobatics.** Weaving through dense traffic at high speeds, drifting through a turn, or executing aerial tricks.
- **Athletics.** Pushing another vehicle out of your path, jumping a gap, or powering through a steep incline.
- **Stealth.** Tailing a vehicle without being noticed, silently gliding through the water, avoiding being spotted against cloud or ground cover from below or above, respectively. 

Characters without proficiency in the class of vehicle may not add their proficiency bonus to the skill check as it relates to operating the vehicle, even if they are otherwise proficient in that skill.  

### Action Stations 
A creature can use an action of the station it’s occupying. Once a creature uses a station’s action, that action can’t be used again until the start of that creature’s next turn. Reactions may still be taken. Only one creature can occupy each station. 

A creature not occupying an action station is either in a passenger seat or clinging to the outside of the vehicle. It can take actions as normal. 

#### Driver's Seat 
The driver's seat of a vehicle puts its occupant directly in front of the vehicle's controls.  The driver can effectively grant the vehicle its own actions to control the vehicle on the driver's turn, using the  
vehicle's statistics as appropriate. Controlling  
a vehicle effectively requires both the driver's  
hands. A driver can also choose to forego  
this option and use their action normally. If  
the driver is incapacitated, leaves the  
driver's seat, does nothing to alter the  
vehicle’s course and speed, or takes an  
action other than controlling the vehicle,  
the vehicle moves in the same direction  
and at the same speed as it did during  
the driver’s last turn until it hits an  
obstacle big enough to stop it. 

A vehicle with no driver automatically  
fails all ability checks, skill checks,  
and saving throws.  
:::
#### Front Passenger Seat 
The front passenger seat sits immediately adjacent to the driver's seat. The vehicle does not require a front passenger to operate. A vehicle with a missing or incapacitated driver makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage instead of automatically failing. 

If the driver is missing or otherwise incapacitated, a front passenger proficient with the vehicle type can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws made using the vehicle's ability scores.

#### Gunner's Position
Certain vehicles, such as tanks or improvised fighting vehicles, may have dedicated weapons stations ranging from heavy cannons to conventional machine guns. A creature occupying the gunner's position can make an attack with the vehicle's weapon(s) as opposed to their own. 

### Range 
Every vehicle has a range, which is the maximum distance it can travel from a full fuel tank or maximum vehicle charge.  

### Mishaps 
Roll on the Mishaps table when one of the following occurs to a vehicle while it’s in motion: 

- The vehicle takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than its mishap threshold, calculated at 33% of its total HP.
- The vehicle fails an ability check (or its  
driver fails an ability check using  
the vehicle’s  
ability) by more  
than 5. 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote CHAPTER 8 | VEHICLES}}
\page

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/i44cKws.jpg' style='position:absolute;Bottom:0px;Right:0px;width:816px;mix-blend-mode:multiply'/>

If a mishap has a repair DC, the mishap can be ended by making repairs to the vehicle (see “Repairs” below).

##### Mishaps 
| d20 | Mishap | Repair DC |
|:------------------|:-----|:-----------------:|
| 1-3 | **Engine Flare.** Fire erupts from the engine and engulfs the vehicle. Any creature that starts its turn on or inside the vehicle takes 10 (3d6) fire damage until this mishap ends.     | 15 (DEX)                |
| 4-6  | **Locked Steering.** The vehicle can move in a straight line only. It automatically fails Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws until this mishap ends.     | 15 (STR)               |
| 7-9 | **Engine Rupture.** The vehicle’s speed decreases by 30 feet until this mishap ends.     | 15 (STR)                |
| 10-12 | **Blinding Smoke.** The vehicle fills with smoke and is heavily obscured until this mishap ends. Any creature in the driver's seat is blinded by the smoke.      | 15 (DEX)               |
| 13-15 | **Ugly Dent.** The vehicle’s damage threshold is reduced by 10 until this mishap ends.      | 15 (STR)              |
| 16-18 | **Damaged Axle.** The vehicle grinds and shakes uncontrollably. Until the mishap ends, the vehicle has disadvantage on all Dexterity checks, and all ability checks and attack rolls made by creatures on or inside the vehicle have disadvantage.     | 15 (DEX)               |
| 19-20 | **Flip.** The vehicle flips over, falls prone, and comes to a dead stop in an unoccupied space. Any unsecured creature holding on to the outside of the vehicle must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be thrown off, landing prone in a random unoccupied space within 20 feet of the overturned vehicle. Creatures inside the vehicle fall prone and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.     | None               |

\column

#### End a Mishap 
A creature can use its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap (see the Mishaps table), with disadvantage if the vehicle is moving. The creature adds its proficiency bonus to the check if it’s proficient with the tools used to make the repairs. A successful check ends the mishap. A mishap with no repair DC can’t be repaired. 

### Vehicular Exhaustion 
The harsh conditions or extensive damage can cause a vehicle to stop functioning properly, until it eventually breaks down. Such wear and tear can be represented using exhaustion, as described in appendix A of the PHB, with these modifications: 
- When a vehicle reaches exhaustion level 6, its hit points drop to 0, and the vehicle breaks down. 
- The only way to remove the effects of exhaustion on a vehicle is to repair the vehicle. 

### Repairs 
When a vehicle is damaged, suffers a mishap, or gains one or more levels of exhaustion, a creature can attempt to make repairs to the vehicle. The creature making the repairs must meet the following criteria: 

- The creature can’t operate the vehicle’s driver's seat or one of its other stations while making repairs. 
- The creature must be within reach of the damaged area in need of repair. 
- The creature must have the right tools for the job (smith’s tools or tinker’s tools, for example). 

Before beginning repairs, a creature must decide whether the repairs are aimed at ending a mishap, removing a level of exhaustion, or restoring the damaged vehicle’s hit points. Each option is discussed below. 

### Remove Exhaustion 
If the vehicle has one or more levels of exhaustion, a  
 {{width:20px}} creature can spend 1 hour or more trying to reduce  
  {{width:100px}} the vehicle’s exhaustion level. The  
   {{width:165px}} vehicle must be stationary,  
  
{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote CHAPTER 8 | VEHICLES}}
\page

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/ggNAhnO.jpg' style='position:absolute;Bottom:0px;Right:0px;width:816px;mix-blend-mode:multiply'/>

and the creature must have spare parts to make the necessary repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes a DC 15 Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it’s proficient with the tools used to make repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle’s exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the check fails, the vehicle’s exhaustion level remains unchanged, though the repair can be attempted again using the same replacement parts. 

### Restore Hit Points 
If the vehicle has taken damage but has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more trying to patch the body and replace damaged parts. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the spare parts to make the necessary repairs. 

After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it’s proficient with the tools used to make repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. If the check fails, the vehicle regains no hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same replacement parts. 

### Crashing 
When a vehicle crashes into something that could reasonably damage it, such as an iron wall or another vehicle of its size or bigger, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6). Whatever the vehicle struck takes the same amount of damage. 

Each creature on or inside the vehicle when it crashes must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6), or half as much damage on a successful save. 

\column

### Crashing into Creatures 
A vehicle can crash into a creature by entering its space. The creature can use its reaction to attempt to get out of the vehicle’s way, doing so and taking no damage with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the vehicle slams into the creature and deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage to the creature for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6). 

A vehicle that is at least two size categories bigger than the creature it crashed into can continue moving through that creature’s space if the vehicle has any movement left. Otherwise, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop, and each creature on or inside the vehicle when it crashes must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6), or half as much damage on a successful save. 

### Falling 
When a vehicle goes over a cliff or otherwise falls, the vehicle and all creatures on or inside it take damage from the fall as normal (1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, maximum 20d6) and land prone. 
 
## Vehicle Chases
Chases are described in Chapter 8 of the DMG, but existing rules are designed primarily for foot chase encounters. While the same basic rules apply, there are additional considerations when staging a chase with modern vehicles. 

### Beginning a Chase
While vehicle operation is described earlier in this chapter, chases play out as their own sort of combat  
 {{width:100px}} encounter. If a creature should reach  
  {{width:140px}} a vehicle and attempt to use it  
   {{width:170px}} to flee, and other  
   
{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote CHAPTER 8 | VEHICLES}}
\page

characters attempt to pursue in their own vehicle, this initiates a new encounter. The DM will determine the starting distance gap between the participants in the chase, and each creature rolls initiative. While vehicle operators will largely dictate the speed of the chase, every participant may take actions to impact the results of the chase on their turn. 

### Accounting for Speed 
Due to the high speeds of modern vehicles, conventional table top grid maps will quickly encounter physical space limitations. Instead of tracking the distance traveled by creatures involved in a chase, participants are tracked on a map grid according to their distance from each other. Distance traveled, if relevant to the escape conditions of the encounter, and terrain obstacles are tracked and described by the DM as necessary, but the map grid is used entirely for relative positioning of the participants. 

{{note
##### Example
Bruenor, Drizzt, and Regis are in pursuit of a truck full of smuggled weapons. Their quarry is a box truck with a speed of 90 feet, while Regis is behind the wheel of a sedan with a speed of 120 feet. At the start of the chase, the DM declares the starting gap between the two parties to be 50 feet. Both vehicles move their full speed during the first round, encountering no other obstacles, and at the end of the round are within 20 feet of each other, the Sedan's higher speed closing a 30 foot gap.
}}

### Maneuvers and Obstacles
If every chase were simply a drag race, then the vehicle with the faster movement speed would always overtake a vehicle with a lower movement speed in short order, making for a very boring chase. This is where maneuvers and obstacles come in. Performing a maneuver or avoiding an obstacle under the stressful conditions of a vehicle chase requires a successful ability check on the part of the vehicle operator, or the vehicle will suffer an effect dictated by the obstacle or a mishap determined by rolling on the mishap table. 

#### Maneuvers
Some maneuvers are relatively simple, such as braking or making a turn. The difficulty of these maneuvers is determined by the speed of the vehicle

##### Turns
As noted in the table below, turn difficulty is based on a combination of angle and speed. The DC of the check increases when taking sharper turns at faster speeds. A creature may brake, slowing the speed of the vehicle in order to make for an easier check, or attempt a harder turn by slowing only slightly or not at all. 

| Turn Angle | Base DC | DC Increase |
|:------------------|:--------:|:-----------------:|
| 30 degree         | 10 (DEX)    | +1/10 feet of speed over 80                |
| 45 degree         | 12 (DEX)    | +1/10 feet of speed over 70                |
| 90 degree         | 15 (DEX)    | +1/10 feet of speed over 60                |
| 180 degree hairpin| 20 (DEX)    | +1/10 feet of speed over 50                |

{{note
##### Example
In their pursuit of the box truck, Bruenor's party has fallen behind to a distance of 70 feet. Ahead, the participants are approaching a T-intersection. The box truck reduces its speed from 90 to 60 in order to maintain a DC 15 dexterity check to make a hard right turn. 

Regis, however, wants to close the distance and opts to drift through the turn at maximum 120 speed. He succeeds on his roll, flying through the turn with tires squealing, and completes the maneuver having closed the gap between the two vehicles to only 10 feet. 
}}

##### Braking 
A vehicle is presumed to be able to brake to a stop normally, even if moving at maximum speed, provided there is space equal to its speed in which to decelerate. For example, a sports car with a speed of 140 feet can come to a stop without issue if it has 140 feet of open space in front of it. If, however, it is moving at maximum speed and a barrier blocks its way less than 140 feet ahead, it will need to succeed on a brake check to avoid a collision. Braking is performed with a Dexterity Check using the vehicle's attributes and any driver proficiency, if applicable. 

The base DC for braking is 10, and for every 10% of distance below the vehicle's current speed the DC increases by 2. A vehicle cannot safely come to a stop in a space less than 50% of its current speed, but can still decelerate to 50% of their current speed for the purposes of reducing any collision damage. 

{{note
##### Example
As the pursuit of the box truck continues, the two vehicles encounter a semi truck jackknifed across the road, blocking the street 60 feet ahead of them. Both vehicles slam on the brakes to avoid a collision. The box truck, moving at 60 feet is able to successfully stop without a check. Bruenor’s party, however, is still moving at 120 feet. This is an even 50% of the vehicle’s current speed, adding a +10 to the base braking DC for a total of 20. Regis rolls a 17 on his brake check, meaning he is unable to stop in time, however he can still reduce his speed to 60, which reduces the collision damage to 6d6 as opposed to 12d6.
}}

#### Obstacles
Some obstacles require more than a simple turn to avoid, and may utilize other skills and abilities in order to effectively avoid. The following table provides a list of options to randomly generate obstacles that add flavor and challenge to your chase encounter. 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote CHAPTER 8 | VEHICLES}}
\page

##### Chase obstacles

| D20 | Obstacle |
|:---|:-----------------------|
| 1  |**Rough Road.** A section of unpaved road threatens to slow your progress. You must make a DC 10 dexterity check to navigate the area or the ground will count as 60 feet of difficult terrain, slowing you to half speed.   | 
| 2  |**Dust Devil.** A dust cloud blows across your path, obscuring your vision for the next two rounds. Any check made to avoid further obstacles or maneuvers is made with disadvantage if the vehicle's speed is over 40.       | 
| 3  | **Owlbear Crossing.** Oblivious wildlife wanders into the road. Make a DC 15 Dexterity check to swerve around it. On a failure, the vehicle takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.     | 
| 4  |**Traction Control.** A patch of black ice (or an oil slick, weather depending) blankets the road. Make a DC 15 Dexterity check to maintain control of the vehicle. On a failure, the vehicle goes into a spin. Roll a d8: a result of 1 means the vehicle maintains its original heading. Subsequent values represent increasing 45 degree angles of rotation (i.e. a 5 means that the vehicle is facing backwards).     |
| 5  | **The bridge is out!**   A section of bridge spanning a  dry wash is collapsed. Vehicles must succeed on a DC 15 Athletics check to jump the gap, or else it takes 2d6 falling damage and must navigate 30 feet of difficult terrain to drive up and out of the wash.   | 

\column
::
| D20 | Obstacle |
|:---|:-----------------------|
| 6  | **Train crossing.**   Lights flash and arms descend as a freight train approaches a crossing ahead of you. Vehicles must succeed on a DC 15 athletics check to power around or through the crossing arms and beat the train. On a failure, the vehicle takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage and must role on the mishap table regardless of whether the damage taken exceeds the vehicle’s damage threshold. On a failure of five or more below the DC, the damage increases to 15d6.   | 
| 7  | **Speed Trap.**  A highway patrol vehicle is posted behind a billboard. A driver must succeed on a DC 12 perception roll in order to notice the speed trap. If they spot the trap, they can then attempt a DC 15 stealth check to hide behind larger vehicles and avoid the officer’s notice. On a failed stealth check, or if the speed trap is not noticed, then the patrol vehicle joins the chase in pursuit. If the chase continues for more than 4 rounds without the patrol vehicle being lost or disabled, an additional 1d4 patrol vehicles join the chase.  |
| 8  | **Blind Corners.**  A series of tight branching turns, obscured by fauna or buildings, lay ahead of you. The pursued vehicle makes a stealth check, opposed by the pursuing creature(s) perception check. If the pursued vehicle is unnoticed, it gains an additional 50 feet of distance from its pursuers.  |
| 9  | **Tax Dollars at Work.** Construction obstructs the road ahead with a variety of equipment, traffic cones, and distraught crewmembers. A DC 15 Acrobatics check is required to avoid the scattered equipment. On a failed save, the vehicle takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. |

##### Chase obstacles (Cont.)

| D20 | Obstacle |
|:---|:-----------------------|
| 10  | **Highway to Hell.** Some powerful yet mischievous wizard has cast a *Gate* spell at either end of a tunnel. Driving into the tunnel instantly transports the vehicle and all occupants to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Geysers of flame erupt around the vehicle. A DC 12 Dexterity check is required to weave between the geysers. On a failed check, the vehicle takes 6d6 fire damage. The vehicle exits the Plane of Fire at the end of its turn, exiting out the other end of the tunnel having covered its maximum distance at the speed it entered the tunnel.    |
| 11  | **Speed Limit Enforced by Wyverns.** An airborne creature swoops in from above and joins the chase. The DM chooses a flying creature of an appropriate challenge rating for the party.     |
| 12  | **Not the Bees!** The vehicle passes through a cloud of angry, stinging insects. Each occupant of the vehicle must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution check or take 4d4 piercing damage. The swarm follows the vehicle for 3 rounds and vehicle occupants must make a new Constitution check each round to continue avoiding damage. The swarm can be dispelled early if it is killed: it has an AC of 12 and 22 hit points, and at half hit points or less the damage from the swarm is reduced to 2d4.       |
| 13  |  **Myconid Migration.** A number of lost Myconids have stumbled onto the surface and are confused and disoriented. As the vehicle approaches, they release a cloud of *Pacifying Spores*. Each occupant in the vehicle must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution check or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.    |
| 14  | **Damn Kids.** Meddlesome teenagers on an overpass are hurling fruit into traffic. Overripe fruits splatter across the windshield and the driver is considered to be blinded until the windshield is cleared manually by a creature making a DC 12 Dexterity check. On a failed check, the window is not cleaned and the creature must succeed on a secondary DC 10 Dexterity check to avoid falling from the vehicle.      |

\column
::
| D20 | Obstacle |
|:---|:-----------------------|
| 15  | **Under the Bridge.** As the vehicle passes over a bridge or overpass, a group of disturbed trolls take exception to someone trying to bypass their tolling scam. The trolls make an opportunity attack against the vehicle as it passes with +7 to hit, doing 1d6+4 damage. On a successful hit, roll on the mishap table.     |
| 16-20  | **Open Road.** no obstacle.|

The table above is meant as a starting place for DMs. It is encouraged to sketch out a rough map of the route you want your chase to take and plan out a series of sequential obstacles that characters will encounter over the course of the chase. Those obstacles may be of your own making; create challenges that make sense for the setting and environment in which the chase takes place. While the obstacles table is geared towards car chases, a school of angry piranha or an agitated griffon make good challenges for a boat or helicopter chase, respectively. 

### Ending a Chase 
A vehicle chase is concluded when one side or the other stops, either voluntarily or by being killed or incapacitated; when the quarry escapes its pursuers by stealth or distance; or when a vehicle is destroyed or disabled such that it cannot continue the chase.

**Components:**   :: V, S, M (hacking tools)
**Duration:**     :: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You gain advantage on all Intelligence checks  using hacking tools to break software encryption  or online security when using a foreign system.  This spell also allows you to break 2nd level and  
lower protective spells such as arcane lock or  glyph of warding by making an Intelligence check  using hacking tools against the spell save DC of the spell’s caster. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell  using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can  attempt to counteract a spell set to secure the  foreign system if the spell’s level is equal to or  less than the level of the spell slot you used. 

\column

#### Commune with City 
*5th-level divination (ritual) (technomagic)* 
**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous 

You briefly become one with the city and gain knowledge of the surrounding area. Aboveground, this spell gives you knowledge of the area within 1 mile of you. In sewers and other underground settings, you gain knowledge of the area within 600 feet of you. 

You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area. 
Terrain and bodies of water 
Prevalent buildings , plants, animals, or intelligent creatures 
Powerful (CR 1 or higher) celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead. 
Influences from other planes of existence Electrical currents, wireless signals, and active transit lines and tracks. 

For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of electrical power or interface, and the location of any nearby parks. 

#### Conjure Knowbot 
*4th-level conjuration (technomagic)*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes 

You touch a single computerized device or computer system to conjure a knowbot—a partially sentient piece of software imprinted with vestiges of your own skills and computer abilities. For the duration of the spell, you can use a bonus action to have the knowbot execute a computer related task that would normally require an action. The knowbot makes Intelligence ability checks using your ability score and proficiency bonuses including your proficiency with hacking tools, if applicable. 

You have a limited telepathic bond with the knowbot, out to a range of 500 feet from the device or system where the knowbot was conjured. If you move beyond this range, the knowbot disappears in 2d4 rounds, as if the duration of the spell had expired. Moving within range again immediately reestablishes the bond. 

The knowbot is bound to the system in which it was created, and it stays there until it is dismissed or the spell’s duration expires. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell’s duration increases to 1 hour. Additionally, your telepathic bond with the knowbot is effective out to a range of 1,000 feet, and if you leave the range of the bond, the knowbot

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a small piece of copper wire)
**Duration:**     :: Concentration, up to 1 hour 

This spell works to actively hide your presence within a computer system. For the spell’s  duration, you and any other users you choose on your local network gain a +10 bonus to  Intelligence checks to avoid detection by  administrators, knowbots, tracking software,  and the like. Whenever you and your chosen  users leave any computer system you are  working in while this spell is in effect, all trace of  your previous presence in that system is erased.

#### Find Vehicle 
*2nd-level conjuration (technomagic)* 
**Casting Time:** ::10 minutes 
**Range:** ::30 feet 
**Component:** ::V, S 
**Duration:** ::8 hours 

\column

You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a nonmilitary land vehicle of your choice, appearing in an unoccupied space within range. The vehicle has the statistics of a normal vehicle of its sort, though it is celestial, fey, or fiendish (your choice in origin). The physical characteristics of the vehicle reflect its origin to some degree. For example, a fiendish SUV might be jet black in color, with tinted windows and a sinister-looking front grille. 

You have a supernatural bond with the conjured vehicle that allows you to drive beyond your normal ability. While driving the conjured vehicle, you are considered proficient with vehicles of its type, and you add double your proficiency bonus to ability checks related to driving the vehicle. While driving the vehicle, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the vehicle. 

If the vehicle drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss the vehicle at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. 

You can't have more than one vehicle bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the vehicle from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can conjure a nonmilitary water vehicle large enough to carry six Medium creatures. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can conjure a nonmilitary air vehicle large enough to carry ten Medium creatures. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can conjure any type of vehicle, subject to the DM's approval.

#### Haywire 
*3rd-level enchantment (technomagic)* 
**Casting Time:** ::1 action 
**Range:** ::90 feet 
**Component:** ::V, S 
**Duration:** ::Concentration, up to 1 minute 

This spell plays havoc with electronic devices, making the use of such devices all but impossible. Each electronic device in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range is subject to random behavior while it remains within the area. A device not held by a creature is automatically affected. If an electronic device is held by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the device affected by the spell. 

At the start of each of your turns, roll a d6 for each affected device to determine its behavior. Except where otherwise indicated, that behavior lasts until the start of your next turn while this spell is in effect. 

\column

##### Spell Effect
| d6 | Effect | 
|:---------------|:--------------|
| 1                 | The device shuts down and must be restarted. Do not roll again for this device until it is restarted. |
| 2-4               | The device does not function    | 
| 5               | The device experiences a power surge, causing an electric shock to the wielder (if any and one random creature within 5 feet of the device. Each affected creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.      | 
| 6            | The device is usable as normal.     | 


**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius of the sphere affected by the spell increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd. 

#### Infallible Relay 
*1st-level divination (technomagic)*
**Casting Time:** ::1 minute 
**Range:** ::Self 
**Component:** ::V, S, M (a mobile phone) 
**Duration:** ::Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

With this spell, you can target any creature with whom   
 {{width:5px}} you have spoken previously, as long as the two of you  
  {{width:10px}} are on the same plane of existence. When you cast  
   {{width:10px}} the spell, the nearest functioning telephone or similar  
    {{width:10px}} communications device within 100 feet of the target begins to ring. If there is no suitable device close enough to the target, the spell fails. 

The target must make a successful Charisma saving throw or be compelled to answer your call. Once the connection is  
 {{width:5px}} established, the call is crystal clear and cannot be dropped until the conversation has ended or the spell’s duration ends. You can end the conversation at any  
  {{width:10px}} time, but a target must succeed on a Charisma saving  
   {{width:10px}} throw to end the conversation. 

#### Invisibility to Cameras 
*3rd-level illusion (technomagic)* 
**Casting Time:** ::1 action 
**Range:** ::10 feet 
**Component:** ::V, S, M (a scrap of black paper) 
**Duration:** ::Concentration, up to 1 minute 

Four creatures of your choice within range become undetectable to electronic sensors and cameras for the duration of the spell. Anything a target is wearing or carrying is likewise undetectable as long as it is on the target's person. The targets remain visible to vision.

#### On / Off 
*Transmutation cantrip (technomagic)* 
**Casting Time:** ::1 action 
**Range:** ::60 feet 
**Component:** ::V, S 
**Duration:** ::Instantaneous 

This cantrip allows you to activate or deactivate any electronic device within range, as long as the device has a clearly defined on or off function that can be easily accessed from the outside of the device. Any device that requires a software- based shutdown sequence to activate or deactivate cannot be affected by on/off. 

#### Power Device 
*1st-level transmutation (technomagic)* 
**Casting Time:** ::1 action 
**Range:** ::Touch 
**Component:** ::V, S
**Duration:** ::Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

You touch an electrical or mechanical  
device that requires a power source.  
For the duration of the spell, the  
device functions exactly as it  
normally would if it had  
conventional power.

This spell can affect any  
household or handheld device,  
or general-purpose vehicle.  
Larger or more intricate devices  
cannot be powered with this spell.

#### Protection from Ballistics 
*3rd-level abjuration* 
**Casting Time:** ::1 action 
**Range:** ::Touch 
**Component:** ::V, S, M (a shell casing)

#### Remote Access 
*1st-level transmutation (technomagic)* 
**Casting Time:** ::1 action 
**Range:** ::120 feet 
**Component**: ::V, S 
**Duration:** ::10 minutes 

You can use any electronic device within range as if it were in your hands. This is not a telekinesis effect. Rather, this spell allows you to simulate a device's mechanical functions electronically. You are able to access only functions that a person using the device manually would be able to access. You can use remote access with only one device at a time. 

#### Shutdown 
*5th-level transmutation (technomagic)* 
**Casting Time:** ::1 action 
**Range:** ::120 feet 
**Component:** ::V, S 
**Duration:** ::Concentration, up to 1 minute 

This spell shuts down all electronic devices within range that are not wielded by or under the direct control of a creature. If an electronic device within range is used by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to prevent the device from being shut down. While the spell remains active, no electronic device within range can be started or restarted.

\page

#### Synchronicity 
*4th-level enchantment* 
**Casting Time:** ::1 action 
**Range:** ::Touch 
**Component:** ::V, S 
**Duration:** ::Concentration, up to 1 hour 

The creature you touch feels reality subtly shifted to its favor while this spell is in effect. The target isn't inconvenienced by mundane delays of any sort. Traffic lights are always green, there's always a waiting elevator, and a taxi is always around the corner. The target can run at full speed through dense crowds, and attacks of opportunity provoked by the target's movement are made with disadvantage. 

Synchronicity grants advantage to Dexterity (Stealth) checks, since the target always finds a handy piece of cover available. Additionally, the target has advantage on all ability checks made to drive a vehicle. 

In the event that two or more creatures under the effect of synchronicity are attempting to avoid being inconvenienced by each other, the creatures engage in a contest of Charisma each time the effects of the spells would oppose each other. 

#### System Backdoor 
*4th-level transmutation (technomagic)* 
**Casting Time:** ::1 minute 
**Range:** ::Touch 
**Component:** ::V, S, M (hacking tools) 
**Duration:** ::Concentration, up to 1 hour 

\column

This spell allows you to bypass system security in order to create a secure login on a foreign system. The login you create allows you administrator-level privileges in any computer system not enhanced through technomagic. The login defeats any technomagic spells of 3rd level or lower. 

Once the duration of the spell expires, the login and all privileges are wiped from the system. System logs still show the activity of the user, but the user identification cannot be found or traced. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you are able to bypass technomagic spells if the spell’s level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used. 

#### Wire Walk 
*4th-level conjuration (technomagic)* 
**Casting Time:** ::1 action 
**Range:** ::10 feet 
**Component:** ::V
**Duration:** ::8 hours 

This spell creates a magical link between a machine within range and another machine, at any distance, on the same plane of existence. You must have seen or touched the destination machine at least once before, and be able to access it. As long as neither machine is destroyed or disconnected, any creature can transport themselves from an adjacent space at one machine to an adjacent space at the other machine. This transportation takes 5 feet of a creature's normal movement. 

#### Trip 
*Conjuration, cantrip* 
**Casting Time:** ::1 action 
**Range:** ::30 feet 
**Component:** ::S 
**Duration:** ::Instantaneous 

You twist the fortunes of a Large or smaller creature you can see within range causing it to misstep. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. 

This spell does not affect flying or hovering creatures.

# Appendix A: Additional Firearm Statistics
The Weapons table in Chapter 5 is a general summary of firearms and their statistics based on broad category generalizations. These weapon statistics will meet the needs of the majority of play groups. If desired, statistics in this section can be used to add greater granularity and options for both DMs and players. This may be mechanical, if you want to distinguish between a farmer with a double-barreled shotgun and a SWAT team with a semi-automatic tactical shotgun. Or it may be purely aesthetic, and the theater of the mind is made more colorful by the presence of not simply a "pistol" but a "Desert Eagle .50", as Guy Ritchie so colorfully observed.

In this Appendix, statistics for a wider variety of firearms are made available for your use. 

### Firearm Operation and Properties 
A firearm is really a weapon system made up of two parts — the gun itself and the ammunition it fires. Each is largely useless without the other; you won't do any damage throwing bullets at anyone and a gun without bullets doesn't serve much of a purpose. Unless it's heavy. Then you can always hit someone with it. 

#### Ammunition
Modern ammunition is built around the cartridge. While the cartridge has existed in some form since at least the 16th century, their use as the standard in small arms was limited until the mid-19th century. A cartridge is a self-contained package consisting of a weapon's projectile, the propellant, a primer, and a casing to hold it all together. Collectively, these are referred to as a single cartridge or round of ammunition. 

Cartridges are loaded into a firearm, either individually or by use of a magazine, to make them ready to fire. 

#### Magazines
A magazine refers to any device used to feed ammunition into the action of a repeating firearm. The size of a weapon's magazine dictates how many rounds of ammunition can be fired from the weapon before reloading. The various types of magazines are described in Chapter 5. While there are a surprising variety of magazine types in use, from the simple single-stack pistol box magazine to the complex helical magazine, the most important thing is to never, *ever* refer to them as "clips". 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote APPENDIX A | ADDITIONAL FIREARM STATISTICS}}
\page

#### Rate of Fire
A weapon's Rate of Fire is a measure of how fast it can fire its projectiles. In the real world, rate of fire can be highly variable depending on factors not just related to the weapon's mechanical capability, but also the skill and training of the operator. For the purposes of this book, rate of fire is focused entirely on the mechanics of a weapon's action, and is divided into five categories. A weapon may have more than one Rate of Fire listed, meaning it has different settings allowing it to fire in each of the indicated fire modes. These are called "select fire" weapons.  

**Single Shot.** Single shot weapons are as the name implies: they can fire a single round of ammunition before they must be reloaded. Certain shotguns and older-model military rifles tend to be single-shot, but they have understandably fallen out of favor in the modern day.

**Repeating.** Repeating weapons encompass a number of different firing mechanisms, such as bolt, lever, and pump action rifles and shotguns. The distinguishing similarity is that all require manual operation of the weapon's action in order to chamber the next round. 

**Semiautomatic.** The overwhelming majority of modern day firearms are semiautomatic. This means that upon firing, the weapon's action is automatically cycled to chamber the next round, but subsequent shots still require the shooter to manually engage the trigger in order to fire. Barring superhuman reflexes, semiautomatic weapons can generally fire as fast as the operator can pull the trigger. 

**Automatic.** Often restricted to military rifles, fully automatic firearms operate by not just automatically cycling the weapon's action upon firing, but also permit continuous fire for as long as the trigger is depressed or until the weapon exhausts its ammunition. 

**Burst.** A sub-category of automatic fire, a burst weapon automatically fires a set number of rounds for each pull of the trigger. Burst fire is often (but not always) a category of a select-fire automatic rifle. 

### Pistols 

A pistol is the colloquial term for all categories of compact, one-handed firearms. Originally considered to be largely ceremonial due to their relative expense and lesser battlefield function, handguns are today possibly the most common type of firearm likely to be encountered by the layman. Popular as duty weapons for law enforcement, backup weapons for military personnel, and as self-defense tools for civilians, the pistol has come to be the preeminent personal weapon on the planet.

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/N9VMj99.png' style='position:absolute;Top:20px;Right:-10px;width:500px;mix-blend-mode:multiply'/>
::::::::::::::::

The Italian firm of Beretta is one of the oldest currently-operating companies still in existence and can trace its lineage back to the Middle Ages. Since World War II, it has become known for its popular semi-automatic pistol and shotgun lines. The Model 92 served as the US military standard service sidearm from 1985 until 2017 under the designation "M9". It has also enjoyed popularity as a favored prop in a number of Hollywood and Hong Kong action movies.

:::::::::::::::::

:
The Model 93R, while visually similar to the Model 92 series, distinguishes itself with one unique feature: a three-round burst setting, uncommon to most pistols. While this gives it a significantly higher rate of fire than comparable weapons in its size category, hoping for accurate shots on target is optimistic at the best of times. The 93R features a folding foregrip in front of the trigger guard to attempt to counteract this known

:::::::::::::::
The 1911 is perhaps the most iconic autoloader pistol design of all time. Designed by John Browning in the early 1900s, it has seen continuous use since its adoption by the US Army in its namesake year.  

The original patent filing for the 1911 expired in 1928 and today you would be hard pressed to find a firearms manufacturer that *doesn't* produce a variant of the 1911 design. Many variants exist, ranging from different chamberings to the addition of an accessory rail, but the base model 1911 is now well into its second century of use and shows no signs of fading in popularity.

The Python is another of Colt's iconic designs, and the most popular of its line of "snake guns", each named after a type of deadly snake. The Python's famous profile can be recognized by its ventilated barrel rib and full-length ejector shroud, which give it a slightly barrel-heavy balance that resists muzzle climb. Discontinued in the 90s, its enduring popularity (and consistently high resale price tag) prompted a manufacturing comeback in 2020.

The massive Desert Eagle is a statement gun if ever there was one. Designed by the American Magnum Research, Inc. and licensed to Israeli Military Industries, the Desert Eagle was designed as an autoloading pistol competitor to large-bore revolvers. With chamberings in .357 and .44 magnum, it soon was adapted to chamber its most famous variant: the .50 American Express round. Too bulky to be a practical combat handgun, the Desert Eagle is principally a collector handgun. Per the manufacturer themselves, the pistol was actively promoted to Hollywood prop armorers and to date has been used in more than 600 movies, tv shows, and video games.

::::::::::::::
Designed as a companion to the FN P90 under an exploratory effort by NATO to replace the 9mm cartridge, the Five-seveN fires the comparatively high-velocity (for a pistol) 5.7mm round. The Five-seveN's proportions are a bit strange to behold, with the longer cartridge resulting in a somewhat bulkier grip. The distinctive bulged trigger guard, and the tapered frame and slide towards the muzzle complete its odd aesthetics. 

**Special.** The Five-seveN can be purchased with a suppressor. (With the suppressor, the Five-seveN has a Value of 21. when fitted with its suppressor, the Five-SeveN is treated as a *Silent Weapon*; a Listen check (DC 15) is required to notice the sound of the weapon firing.

:::::::::::::::
If there were ever an autoloading pistol to give the 1911's ubiquity a run for its money, that pistol would be the Glock. The Glock family of pistols first emerged in the early 1980s and has proven extremely popular. While it was not the first striker-fired pistol, nor the first to be constructed so extensively using synthetic material, it was certainly the most successful. 

The Glock features a frame made entirely of polymer, and despite what the movies might tell you, the slide and most of the internals are still constructed from steel, meaning that you would not want to go through a metal detector with it if you wanted to avoid a very awkward conversation. Its action features a number of redundant internal safety features, and dual-element trigger acts as both external safety and trigger.

Today, the Glock family of pistols has entered its 5th generation of design, and more than two dozen variants exist in various sizes, calibers. For simplicity, only three distinct variants are listed below.

### Rifles 

Rifles form the backbone of modern military small arms. While the size, build, and features of the rifle have changed dramatically since the first arquebusier marched out of Constantinople, most of the world's infantry are still considered first and foremost to be riflemen. 

Following World War II, the trend in rifle design has shifted strongly towards the oft-misunderstood "assault rifle". Taking the name verbatim from the StG 44 "Sturmgewehr", an assault rifle is a select-fire rifle firing 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote APPENDIX A | ADDITIONAL FIREARM STATISTICS}}
\page
an intermediate power rifle cartridge. The lighter weight, greater capacity, and higher rate of fire support the fire-and-maneuver tactics refined over the World War period, and stand in contrast to the full-power rifle cartridges and precision aimed fire of bolt-action rifles used by most infantry up to that point. 

Ultimately, however, the rifle's core purpose is still largely the same; to serve as the primary combat instrument of the boots-on-the-ground warfighter. The rifle is what soldiers rely on when every other force multiplier has been spent.

#### AK-47

::::::::
Quite possibly the most successful rifle design of the 20th century, the AK-47 - with its wood and steel construction and distinctive "banana" magazine - is instantly recognizable even to the layman. It has seen combat in virtually every theater of war one could care to name for the last half century. A simple manual of arms and a reputation for rugged reliability make it an exceptional partisan and guerilla weapon, and it has been used as such in countless conflicts. Seemingly endlessly adapted and copied, the AK-pattern rifle has been updated and modified dozens of times, re-chambered in a half dozen calibers, adapted into machine guns, sniper rifles, and shotguns, and sold, built, stolen, and smuggled to and by quite literally half the nations in the world. 

Aside from ecological blight and political instability, it is the most enduring remnant of the Soviet Union to this day.

::::::::::

The M16 series of rifles, when initially introduced, was a subject of controversy. After mandating a minimum .30 caliber standard for NATO forces, the United States changed gears with little warning, abandoning the 7.62x51mm round and adopting Eugene Stoner's Armalite Rifle in a scaled-down 5.56mm cartridge. Initial feedback from troops in the field was similarly cool, citing poor performance in jungle conditions (something of an issue in the Vietnam years) and a comparatively weak cartridge when compared to its competitors. Over time, however, as further iterations on the platform were made and the doctrine of small arms engagements developed to emphasize a greater volume of fire, the M16 rifle more than came into its own. 

The M4 carbine is one such iteration. Sporting a shortened 14.5 inch barrel and a telescoping six-position stock, the M4 is light, maneuverable, and endlessly modifiable. Built on an M16A2 trigger group, the M4 is a select-fire rifle firing in semiautomatic and 3-round burst. An improved M4A1 model fires instead in semiautomatic and automatic fire modes, and removes the integrated carry handle in favor of a picatinny top rail for accessory and optic mounting.

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/qLeJOO8.png' style='position:absolute;Top:440px;Left:0px;width:440px;mix-blend-mode:multiply'/>
:::::::::::
Originally designed in the late 1970s, the Steyr AUG (German: *Armee-Universal-Gewehr* or "Army Universal Rifle"), is of a bullpup design, meaning that the magazine is located behind the trigger group as opposed to in front, which allows for a longer barrel while keeping the rifle's overall length compact. While not the first bullpup design (the concept had been put into practice as early as 1901) it was the first to be adopted as a standard-issue infantry rifle. Its distinctive shape and polymer-intensive build make it seem to this day a rifle fitting for the space age. 

Apart from its ergonomics, the most distinctive feature of the AUG is its two-stage trigger; a half-pull will fire the rifle in semi-automatic mode while a full pull will allow it to fire in fully automatic. This negates the need for a physical selector switch and in theory allows for dynamic rate of fire changes as necessary.

### Sniper Rifles 
The sniper rifle is not a new concept, with dedicated precision rifle units going back at least as far as the American Civil War. The sniper rifle itself, however, is a relatively recent innovation. Prior examples of the weapon were particularly high-quality infantry rifles, "accurized" by modifying the weapon with optical sights and stabilizing equipment. Even as late as the Vietnam War, most sniper rifles were little more than modified civilian hunting rifles. 

As sniping evolved into a formalized discipline and militaries began investing the time and resources in training dedicated scout snipers, so too did sniper rifles begin to be constructed as a more purpose-built weapons platform.

:::::::
As late as the 1980s, the United Kingdom's primary sniper rifle was built upon the Lee-Enfield rifle, with a design that dates back to the 1890s. Accuracy International originally developed the Precision Marksman (PM) rifle as part of a contest to replace these outdated designs, and it was adopted into British military service as the L96. In the early 90s, Sweden sought a similar rifle replacement, with specifications to function reliability in colder weather. Accuracy International updated the PM design with de-icing properties that allowed it to function reliabily in temperatures as low as -40 C. Thus, the Arctic Warfare (AW) was born, and has served as the foundation for a whole series of AW variants.

The SVD is evidence of two seemingly eternal truths: the Kalashnikov pattern rifle can be adapted into any small arm you care to name, and the warehouses full of 7.62x54R will always need a delivery system. The SVD was developed as an answer to NATO countries continuing to use full-power rifle cartridges in their primary small arms (namely the FN FAL), whereas the USSR had moved to an intermediate caliber assault rifle. This meant that NATO units typically performed better at range, and Soviet units sought a long-range answer to this shortcoming. In what some might call a sign of doctrinal commitment and others might see as a sign of abject pessimism, the SVD is curious as a long-range rifle that comes from the factory with a bayonet lug.

::::::::
Another example of a purpose-built sniper weapon system, the PSG1 is said to have been developed in response to the 1972 Munich massacre, in which West German police units reportedly lacked the precision shooting capability to engage the hostage-takers without endangering the hostages. The stock, grip, and even the trigger unit are all adjustable to adapt to an individual shooter's preferred ergonomics. These features, in addition to its overall high quality of precision manufacture, make the PSG1 a very expensive rifle. Its adoption is therefore limited, rarely ordered in significant quantities and employed by a small number of military and police units specializing in hostage rescue and counterterrorism.

### Antimateriel Rifles

Antimateriel rifles follow the same basic principles of sniper rifles - engaging targets at long range with precision fire - but with one crucial distinction: they are designed to destroy equipment and vehicles (i.e. "materiel") as opposed to engaging individual human(oid) targets. Originally referred to as "antitank" rifles, advancements in armor over the course of WWII largely negated that application, and today's antimateriel rifles are used for penetrating light armored vehicles, as well as soft targets behind cover. Their use of heavy cartridges gives them greater ballistic stability over long range, making them the weapon of choice for extreme range engagements with small arms.

in a long range weapons platform. Notably, the M82 is a semiautomatic rifle, and utilizes heavy recoil return springs that allow the barrel to travel up to an inch rearwards to absorb the heavy recoil. The M82 and its successor variants have been in service since 1989.

At a certain point, small arms cease to be classified as "rifles" and can officially be described as "cannons". The NTW-20 technically clears this threshold. While still referred to as a rifle, it is chambered for the massive 20x82mm round, a kind of ammunition most commonly used in rotary autocannons on gunships and warplanes. The rifle can also be converted to fire the 14.5mm antimateriel round by changing the bolt, barrel, and magazine, which does allow for increased range and muzzle velocity thanks to the lighter round. This is arguably the more prudent configuration, but once again, if you retain the 20mm round, *you're firing a cannon*.

### Submachine guns 

Machine guns and their high rate of fire changed the scope and speed of warfare, but had one rather obvious drawback: they were heavy and unwieldy, unsuited to the dynamic, fast-moving small unit tactics that emerged from the World War period. The answer to that shortcoming was the submachine gun: an automatic weapon designed to fire pistol cartridges rather than rifle cartridges. This allowed for a surprisingly compact design, as well as a shared ammunition pool for simplified logistics. Reaching the height of their popularity during WWII and the immediate postwar period, submachine guns were a way to get light, cheap, automatic capable weapons into the hands of a large number of combatants. Advances in the design of assault rifles have minimized the role of the submachine gun somewhat, but it remains a popular choice for rear echelon troops, as well as police and bodyguard personnel for its small size and ease of control in tight quarters.

::::::::::::::
A design so popular, that its very name is often used as an eponym for the entire submachine gun class of weapon. Designed for the Israeli army in the 1950s, the Uzi was already a compact, well-balanced weapon in its original configuration. The Mini-Uzi shrinks the weapon even further, allowing for a compact weapon that can more easily be fired one-handed (though it really shouldn't be).

Officially titled the Military Armament Corporation Model 10, the name "Mac-10" is most commonly used by collectors and dealers, especially since the Military Armament Corporation's bankruptcy in 1975. Both light and compact, the Mac-10 saw limited use with special forces units in the Vietnam era, though its light weight made it difficult to control and it was largely upstaged by designs such as the MP5. Its most distinguishing

{{footnote APPENDIX A | ADDITIONAL FIREARM STATISTICS}}

feature is its oversized two-stage suppressor, designed specifically for the weapon. Serving as not just a sound suppressor but also as a means of balancing the featherweight weapon, the suppressor and its abundant internal baffles famously reduced the sound of firing to such an extent that the cycling of the weapon's action cycling can be heard over the gunshot report. 

**Special.** When fitted with its suppressor, the Mac-10 is treated as a *Silent Weapon*; a Listen check (DC 15) is required to notice the sound of the weapon firing.

### Light Machine Guns
"Light", in this instance, is a relative term. Light machine guns are designed to be operated by a single soldier, giving infantry units a comparatively mobile option for sustained automatic fire. Broadly speaking, light machine guns are in a shared category of "general purpose machine guns" which may be used either in tripod-mounted static positions or on vehicles, or by individual soldiers either from a bipod or (inadvisably) from the shoulder. Any machine gun carried and fired from a bipod is considered to be a light machine gun, although that same weapon would be considered a medium machine gun if mounted to a vehicle or fortification. 

#### FN MAG

::::::::
The FN MAG (*Mitrailleuse d'Appui Général* or "general support machine gun") is an enduring Cold War era machine gun. Sold or built under license by dozens of countries, the MAG continues to see extensive use into the present day. Like many postwar designs, the MAG takes significant design cues from the German MG42, most notably its quick-change barrel and trigger mechanism. In its light machine gun infantry role, it is best fired from prone or brace positions using the integrated bipod. While the bipod can be folded parallel to the barrel for use as an improvised handguard for shoulder or hip fire, accuracy is questionable when employed this way.

::::::::::::
A somewhat less-enduring Cold War machine gun, the M60 was another study in lessons learned from German small arms innovations during WWII. While also taking many queues from the MG42, the M60 also utilized a semi-bullpup design, with much of the weapon's action housed in the stock and on a level plane with the receiver, reducing weapon length and recoil. Several awkward design quirks, such as a barrel-mounted bipod that necessitated a second bipod be carried for barrel swaps, and a lack of grip points to change said barrel without risking significant burns to the hands, limited the M60's success. Several enhancements made over the next 30 years following its introduction worked to remedy these flaws, but it was ultimately phased out in favor of the FN MAG and its variants. The M60E4 - enhanced with a forward vertical pistol grip and picatinny mounting rails -  nonetheless continued to see use with special operations teams well into the 1990s, namely the Navy SEALs, who valued the weapon's relatively compact size compared to larger machine of its class.

design has had more than one support weapon built on the workhorse receiver, and the RPK-74M is one such example. Following in the footsteps of the RPK, the RPK-74 was adapted to chamber the 5.45mm round of the AK-74, giving units a shared ammunition pool between rifles and light support weapons. Designed with a heavy barrel, integrated bipod, and a side-folding stock, the RPK-74m compensates for its comparatively low power and capacity by being an extremely mobile weapon, especially when compared against the unwieldy PK-series general purpose machine gun.

### Heavy Machine Guns
In contrast to light and medium machine guns, a heavy machine gun is exactly what the name implies: a machine gun too heavy to be carried and deployed by an individual soldier - or even several soldiers. Heavy machine guns are most often used in fixed gun emplacements or on vehicles, and tend to fire extremely large caliber ammunition. This gives heavy machine guns significantly increased range, anti-vehicle, and anti-fortification capability when compared to smaller weapons. 

#### Browning M2HB

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/wU04lvr.png' style='position:absolute;Top:520px;Left:60px;width:370px;mix-blend-mode:multiply'/>
::::::::
Originally developed in the interwar period and entering service in the 1930s, the M2 is not simply still in use: it remains to this day the *standard* heavy machine gun of all NATO militaries. Because the weapon lacks a shoulder stock and is only intended to be fired from a fixed, mounted position, it has no conventional grip or trigger. Rather, two vertical "spade grips" are affixed to the rear of the weapon and a split "butterfly trigger" is depressed with one or both of the operator's thumbs to fire. It has a relatively slow fire rate of around 600 rounds per minute, but makes up for this with its heavy cartridge and long range. When the bolt release is unlocked, the weapon can even fire in single-shot mode with surprising accuracy. In 1967, a USMC sniper used a modified M2 Browning to record what was then the longest confirmed sniper kill on record. The record stood for 30 years, until the proliferation of antimateriel rifles - many firing the same .50 BMG cartridge - knocked it from the top spot.

::::::::::
The DShK (*Degtyaryova-Shpagina Krupnokaliberny*, "Degtyaryov-Shpagin large-calibre") was the Warsaw Pact competitor to the M2HB and also remains in service to this day. Originally designed in 1938, it was updated with a more reliable feed mechanism in 1948, and more than a million were produced during the Cold War period. Primarily serving as a vehicle weapon, mounted on tanks and armored personnel carriers, when deployed in infantry support roles it is often mounted on a wheeled chassis for faster battlefield movement without requiring disassembly. Its awkward acronym is often replaced with the nickname "Dushka", a Russian word meaning "beloved person".

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/pMNsBnK.png' style='position:absolute;Top:680px;Right:20px;width:410px;mix-blend-mode:multiply'/>
:::::::::
The "mini" in the M134 minigun comes not from its overall size, but rather in comparison to General Electric's significantly larger rotary autocannons, such as the M61 Vulcan. Developed in the early 60s, the minigun was a revival of the 19th century gatling gun concept, using a series of rotating barrels to sustain an incredibly high rate of fire while avoiding barrel overheating that would plague single-barrel designs

{{footnote APPENDIX A | ADDITIONAL FIREARM STATISTICS}}

firing at even a fraction of the speed. The M134 uses an electric motor to rotate the barrels, as opposed to a mechanical gas-driven recoil mechanism for cycling the weapon's action. The M134 is most often employed as a vehicle mounted weapon, excelling as an aircraft weapon that can be used in both close air support roles as well as for suppressing fire for vulnerable light-armored helicopters.

### Shotguns 
Shotguns, in some capacity or another, have existed for about as long as the firearm itself. Predominantly smoothbore (i.e. non-rifled) weapons, many early firearms were capable of firing both bullet and shot, and it was not until the 18th century and the proliferation of rifled muskets that the terminology "shotgun" came into being, referring to a firearm that fired predominantly shot as opposed to bullets. Shotguns are widely used for sporting purposes, and had fallen out of favor in military use until WWI, when the United States began fielding the "trench gun" in general combat, famously leading to a diplomatic protest by Germany, claiming that its use was a violation of the laws of warfare. Shotguns maintain a presence on the modern battlefield as specialty weapons, used for close quarters fighting and door breaching. While their relative short range is often exaggerated in media, shotguns nevertheless excel in short-range engagements.

:::::::
The M4 is the fourth and final iteration of the Benelli Super 90 line of shotguns. Using a proprietary gas operated mechanism, the M4 boasts a self-regulating gas system, meaning it can adapt dynamically to different shot loads and cartridge lengths and still cycle reliably. For low-powered ammunition, such as less-lethal beanbag rounds, the weapon's action must still be cycled manually via the charging lever. The M4 features fewer complex parts compared to other gas-operated designs and performs exceptionally well in harsh conditions. The shotgun also features a proprietary collapsible stock, reducing the weapon's overall length by 8 inches when collapsed. It can be exchanged for a pistol grip fixed stock or a conventional rifle stock. In order to avoid confusion with the Colt M4 series of carbine rifles, the M4 was given the designation M1014 when adopted for US Military use.

::::::::::::
Designed in the US in 1989, the USAS-12 is manufactured in South Korea by the Daewoo conglomerate. A fully automatic fire rate in a shotgun is unusual, with the USAS-12 being one of the only existing examples. This is mostly due to the combat application of such a weapon: while potentially devastating in short close-quarters combat, the capacity limitations of 12-gauge shells result in shorter sustained fire, and range and accuracy are also questionable, limiting its usefulness as a suppressive weapon - arguably the core function of an automatic weapon. Nevertheless, the USAS-12 has met with success in the security forces of a number of countries throughout Latin America and Southeast Asia. And of course, it's hard to argue with the cool factor.

::::::::
You thought we were done with Kalashnikov pattern weapons? Oh, dear reader, no. Not at all. The Saiga-12 and its variants are perhaps the most ambitious adaptation of the venerable AK platform, requiring extensive reworking of the feed and extraction system in order to accommodate the wide 12 gauge shotgun shell. The standout feature, of course, is its magazine feed system. Shotgun box magazines are nothing new, but less common than conventional tube or single-shot break-action designs. While it somewhat limits its versatility when it comes to dynamic loading of different kinds of shells, there is much to be said for a significantly faster mag change vs. loading shells one at a time. Produced as both a civilian market hunting firearm and a military and police combat shotgun, the Saiga is likely one of the more widely-used magazine fed shotguns in the world.

Less a specific brand and more of an institution, the Sears Roebuck & Co. catalogue was - from 1892 to 1988 - an excellent source of affordable, reliable sporting shotguns. Sears accumulated and sold under its banner a huge quantity of foreign and domestic firearms, including a great many of its own "house brand" production line, branded as J.C. Higgins, Ted Williams, A.J. Arbrey Gun Co., and many others whose names are lost to history. The rollmarks differ, the presence of external hammers and number of triggers may be variable, but the simple break-action side-by-side shotgun is an honored - if somewhat archaic - classic.

### Grenade Launchers 
The grenade has typically faced one significant shortcoming; its range is limited for anyone whose throwing arm is lesser in strength than that of an All-Star right fielder. Early attempts to overcome this limitation included low-tech slings and relatively cumbersome rifle grenade adapters which used blank cartridges to propel a rifle-mounted grenade greater distances. The advent of the grenade launcher, using specially-designed grenade rounds, introduced a more elegant solution in a dedicated weapons platform. As a force multiplier, the grenade launcher has been tremendously successful at giving infantry units comparatively short-range explosive ordnance capability in situations where indirect mortar or artillery fire is either too dangerous or unavailable. Modern launchers can either be stand-alone weapons of their own, or supplemental weapons meant to be attached to a soldier's primary rifle. 

Grenade launchers do not have damage statistics of their own, rather they fire specialized large-bore grenade cartridges that mimic the properties of the grenades described in Chapter 5. Refer to the Grenades section of that chapter to determine the damage 

#### Colt M79

:::::::::::
One of the first dedicated grenade launchers to enter widespread service, the M79 is a single-shot break-action design that mimics the properties of a breech-loading shotgun, only significantly larger. Affectionately nicknamed the "blooper" for its distinctive firing sound, the M79 was a welcome and popular addition to a rifle squad. Its size and weight, however, limited secondary firepower for its operators, who often had to rely on 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote APPENDIX A | ADDITIONAL FIREARM STATISTICS}}

pistols when their grenades were expended. The slow reload process was also problematic, and the M79 - while still in use - has largely been replaced by multi-shot launchers and more versatile underbarrel options.

::::::::
Built in response to the shortcomings of the M79, the M203 was designed to be fielded in tandem with a rifle, producing a combination rifle/grenade launcher system that would allow infantry to act as grenadiers without sacrificing their primary weapon. The M203 attaches to a barrel, specialized barrel shroud, or picatinny rail system underneath a rifle, acting as a handguard for the operator. The launcher's action slides open to accommodate reloading from the exposed breech, and the trigger mechanism sits just in front of a rifle's magwell, which can then be used as an improvised grip when firing the launcher. Originally designed specifically for the M16 rifle, the M203 is now designed to fit virtually any rifle with a lower rail integration system and the physical dimensions to accommodate the launcher. It also pioneered the underbarrel launcher concept, which has now been emulated and updated by a number of different manufacturers.

:::::::::
Where most grenade launchers are single-shot in design, the Milkor MGL utilizes a six-round spring-driven revolver-style magazine cylinder. This allows for a much higher rate of fire when compared to break-action single shot launchers. After each round is fired, the cylinder rotates to the next round, but must be wound up upon reloading. While necessarily large in order to accommodate  the additional loaded ammunition, the MGL is surprisingly light at only 12 pounds, making extensive use of aluminum and polymer components. A telescoping stock and vertical foregrip make the weapon easy to handle, and it has become popular worldwide as both an offensive and defensive military weapon, and a riot-control weapon.

## Additional Homebrewing
While both the weapons table in Chapter 5 and this appendix offer players and DMs an abundance of options in equipping their characters, particularly obsessive parties may wish to expand even further upon the options given here by crafting their own weapons. Inspiration from movies, television, video games, or personal experience is encouraged. Want to know what your favorite character from The Matrix used in a particular scene but don't know its name or features offhand? The Internet Movie Firearm Database (imfdb.com) hosts an exhaustive user-created catalog of firearms used in media. With a bit of googling and consultation with this appendix (and your DM) your next encounter can see your character charging into battle with their own Owen gun, H&K G11, or even OTs-38 Stechkin silent revolver. 

Or it may not, in which case I'm shocked you even read this far. 

When creating your own weapons, statistics should generally follow the guidelines laid out by weapons of a similar type given in this section. Generally, damage statistics for firearms should be determined by the ammunition used, and should follow the guidelines in the table below: 

##### Damage by Caliber
| Real World Caliber | Damage | 
|:------------------|:-----:|
| Tiny (.22 LR, .25 ACP, .380 ACP)   | 1d4     | 
| Small (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP)      | 1d6     | 
| Moderate (.357 Magnum, .44 magnum, 5.56mm)               | 1d8     | 
| Standard (30-06, 7.62x51mm)             | 1d10     | 
| High Power (7mm Magnum, .300WM, .338 Lapua)            | 1d12     | 
| Shot (12 gauge)            | 2d6     | 
| Heavy (.50 BMG, 12.7x108mm)            | 2d8    |

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote APPENDIX A | ADDITIONAL FIREARM STATISTICS}}
\page

Range should similarly be comparable to statistics of a similar weapon type. Consider the application of the weapon: will your 9mm pistol be used in countersniping operations? If not, then you probably shouldn't give it that much more range than a PHB hand crossbow. While Wikipedia will often give effective range statistics for a given firearm, keep in mind that the 5-foot square grid is an abstraction of real-world range distance. While an H&K USP might have a stated effective range of 50 meters and a maximum range of 100 meters, that translates to close to 150 feet normal range / 300 feet long range. Accurate to the real world? Sure. But probably overpowered for the purposes of Dungeons and Dragons. 

Magazine type, fire rate, and weight can all be easily ascertained through either Wikipedia or the manufacturer's website. For any special properties, consider any unique differentiators of the weapon in question. The De Lisle Carbine features its own integral suppressor. The Mosin Nagant M44 comes standard with a folding bayonet, making it usable as a (somewhat clumsy) spear in close combat. The Taurus Judge fires compact .410 shotgun shells that might do lesser damage than a 12 gauge, but which may impart the spread property. It will also make the other players at the table laugh at you. With DM permission, you can also work in reverse, combining a set of interesting features and properties into a firearm entirely your own.

##### Example
Bruenor wants to supplement his battle axe with a submachine gun, but one not specifically reflected in the weapons table. Drawing from movies and video games, he decides to build out a Heckler & Koch UMP 45. After a quick consult with Wikipedia, he makes a list of some of the core properties of the weapon. 

He stats out a .45 caliber submachine gun (1d6 damage) with standard range 30 ft and long range 120 ft. He records a box magazine capacity of 25 rounds, and the automatic and burst (2) properties. Satisfied with his work, like any good player he consults his DM for approval before adding the weapon to his character sheet.

# Appendix B: Vehicle Statistics 

While we have covered the rules of vehicle operation in Chapter 7, this appendix is meant to give you a list of vehicles and their associated stat blocks for use in your campaigns. In the modern world, the roads, waterways, and skies are sometimes full to bursting with all manner of vehicles, from innocuous passenger sedans to armed attack helicopters. Each vehicle has its place, and the stats presented here will help you determine how best to utilize them. 


### Basic Statistics 
A vehicle stat block is in many ways similar to that of creatures. Each vehicle has hit points, armor class, speed, ability scores, and so on. This section will review some of the distinct elements of a stat block specific to vehicles. 

#### Size 

Vehicles have size categories similar to creatures, though there is not always a direct correlation between a vehicle's real world size and its size category. For example, in the real world, the average motorboat can be 15 feet long or more, but instead of being Huge, as a creature would usually be, it is a Large vehicle which would imply it is no longer than 10 feet if it were a creature.

Instead of thinking of vehicles in terms of absolute lengths, the size categories are meant to be comparative for different classes of vehicles. Some vehicles are clearly larger or smaller than others. For example, Medium vehicles include motorcycles and jet skis, Large vehicles include cars and speedboats, Huge vehicles include monster trucks and helicopters, and Gargantuan vehicles include buses and yachts. 

#### Vehicle Type 
A vehicle can be a land, water, or air vehicle, depending on the types of special movement available to them. A land vehicle moves or climbs across solid surfaces, a water vehicle has a swimming speed, and an air vehicle has a flying speed.

If a vehicle has more than one movement type, then the precedence of the vehicle's type is determined by whether it has a swimming or flying speed. Water takes precedence over land, and air takes precedence over land and water. For example, the floatplane has both a swimming and flying speed. The flying speed means it is an air vehicle, which takes precedence over its swimming speed.

If a vehicle that lacks a swimming speed enters a liquid substance, it can't move and it begins to sink at a rate of 10 feet per round until it is removed from the liquid.

#### Creature Capacity 
The Creature Capacity determines the amount of people that can comfortably inhabit a vehicle without squeezing, or without exceeding the safety equipment of the vehicle. For example, a car might have space for 5 riders, and any additional riders past the limit may have to squeeze in between other riders, sit on their laps, or even try and find space in the trunk.

The DM decides the exact penalty for exceeding the rider limit. For example, a creature squeezing between other riders or in awkward positions may suffer the effects of a creature squeezing into a smaller place: the squeezing creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against the creature have advantage against the creature. A creature lying in the trunk of a vehicle may have vulnerability to crashing damage. A second rider on a motorcycle may go flying off of it in a crash. Too many people standing on a boat may risk falling overboard in rough weather or in a crash, or even capsizing the boat.

#### Cargo Capacity 
A vehicle's cargo capacity is the amount of weight a vehicle can carry without penalty. The weight of riders does not count against a vehicle's capacity, unless the DM decides that a rider is particularly heavy.

If a vehicle's cargo capacity is exceeded, its fuel efficiency is decreased, the vehicle consumes 2 miles of range for every 1 mile it travels. If a vehicle is carrying more than twice its cargo capacity, its speed is reduced by half. If a vehicle is carrying more than thrice its cargo capacity, the vehicle can't move.

#### Range
As discussed in Chapter 7, a vehicle's range is its maximum distance it can travel with maximum fuel. Fuel for a vehicle can be a variety of fossil fuels, electricity in charged batteries, or another form of energy. Once a vehicle is out of fuel, it can't  
move, can't take actions or reactions, and if  
it would explode when it reaches 0 hit  
points, it does not. Generally, fuel is  
easy to come by in the form of fuel  
stations or electric charging stations,  
however consideration must be  
given to the lack of availability  
of fuel when venturing away  
from civilization.  

#### Ability Scores 
A vehicle has the six  
ability scores and  
modifiers: Strength,  
Dexterity, Constitution,  
Intelligence,  
Wisdom, and  
Charisma.

A vehicle's Strength represents a combination of its size, weight, and the torque or power it can bring to bear. A vehicle's Dexterity describes its handling, braking, acceleration, and stability. A vehicle's Constitution embodies its durability, the sturdiness of its frame, and the amount of damage its internals can sustain before it ceases to function. Constitution also determines a system's internal resilience to meddling from spells. 

Vehicles usually have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and automatically fail any ability check or saving throw using those scores, if the spell would affect it at all. 

#### Hit Points 
A vehicle has hit points, and will be destroyed if they are reduced to 0. A vehicle does not have Hit Dice. To restore hit points, the vehicle must be repaired, as the vehicles hitpoints are not affected by healing items or magic the way that a living creature would be. 

#### Challenge Rating (CR)
Vehicles each have a challenge rating, similar to monsters or non-player characters. When creating a vehicle, you can use a process similar to the 'Creating a Monster' section of the DMG.

The primary difference comes when calculating a vehicle's offensive challenge rating. Many vehicles, such as cars or motorcycles, don't have weapons included in their stat blocks, since they have no weapons installed by default. For these cases it is recommended to calculate a vehicle's offensive challenge rating as though it has weapons installed; use the statistics for a melee weapon mount if the vehicle has a high Strength score, otherwise use the statistics for a ranged weapon mount.

See the 'Vehicle Weapons and Damage' section later in this appendix for more information on arming a vehicle.

#### Vehicle Proficiency Bonus 
A vehicle's proficiency bonus is determined by its challenge rating, in a manner similar to monsters, as shown in the table below.

| Challenge Rating |  Proficiency Bonus |
|:------------------|:----------------------:|
| 0-4               | +2                |
| 5-8               |  +3                |
| 9-12               |  +4                |
| 13-16            |  +5                |
| 17-20             | +6                |
| 21-24            |  +7                |
| 25-28            |  +8                |
| 29-30           |  +9                |

\column

A vehicle's proficiency bonus is added to the relevant ability modifier when the vehicle makes ability checks and saving throws with which it is proficient. It also adds it to ranged weapon attacks that the vehicle makes using its Constitution modifier.

Note that this is not applicable when it comes to player characters; players add their own proficiency bonus based on any applicable vehicle proficiency. Vehicle proficiency here is included for the purposes of vehicles players encounter in combat, for the purposes of simplifying the game and not having to create class levels for every NPC behind the wheel of an opposing vehicle. If the players encounter a vehicle in combat, the creature piloting it is presumed to have proficiency. 

#### Explosive Death 
Almost all vehicles explode when they are reduced to 0 hit points. Typically, targets close to the vehicle must make a Dexterity saving throw to reduce the damage. The DC of the saving throw is 10 + the vehicle's Constitution modifier.

The fire damage caused by the explosion is based on its size category, as shown in the Vehicle Explosion table.

| Vehicle Size |  Fire Damage|
|:------------------|:----------------------:|
| Medium               | 2d6                |
| Large               |  4d6                |
| Huge               |  6d6                |
| Gargantuan         |  8d6               |

#### Actions and Reactions 
Vehicles can have many different types of actions and reactions, although they can't use them unless a driver grants the vehicle its action or reaction. See Chapter 7 for more information on controlling vehicles.

A vehicle may have weapons installed on it through the melee or ranged weapon mount vehicle modifications. Alternatively, it may have special weapons designed for it that have their own properties. Any weapons and other special actions available to the vehicle fall under the Actions section of the vehicle's stat block.

Typically, when the vehicle's special actions and abilities force a target to make a saving throw, the saving throw DC is determined by using the following formula: 

<div style="text-align: center">
**8 + the vehicle's or driver's proficiency bonus + the vehicle's Constitution modifier.**
</div>
:
However, some actions may use other ability modifiers. Vehicles may also have reactions available to them through modifications or special equipment, such as the attack helicopter's Decoy Flare.

#### Vehicle Weapons and Damage 
Vehicles may be equipped with mounted melee and ranged weapons. They can be standard weapons like

\page

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/Sk6kfre.png' style='position:absolute;Top:40px;Right:0px;width:836px;mix-blend-mode:multiply'/>

those available as vehicle modifications, in the form of the Melee Weapon Mount and the Ranged Weapon Mount. Alternatively, they could be weapons specially designed for the vehicle.

When determining the attack bonus and damage of a vehicle's standard Melee Weapon Mount, use the table below. The weapon usually deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, depending on the nature of the weapon.

##### Melee Weapon Mount Attacks
| Size | Attack Bonus | Damage |
|:------------------|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Medium                 | Vehicle's STR modifier + proficiency bonus     | 1d8 + the vehicle's STR modifier                |
| Large               | Vehicle's STR modifier + proficiency bonus     | 2d8 + the vehicle's STR modifier                |
| Huge               | Vehicle's STR modifier + proficiency bonus     | 3d8 + the vehicle's STR modifier                |
| Gargantuan             | Vehicle's STR modifier + proficiency bonus     | 4d8 + the vehicle's STR modifier                |

For the attack bonus of a vehicle's standard Ranged Weapon Mount, the attack bonus depends on whether the attack is made using the driver or passenger's Dexterity or the Vehicle's Constitution for the attack roll, as shown in the Ranged Weapon Mount Attacks table. The distinction is generally made based on how the weapon is used; emplaced weapons like door guns on a helicopter would use a creature's Dexterity modifier, while the main cannon on a tank would use the vehicle's Constitution modifier. The damage type depends on the weapon and ammunition.

##### Ranged Weapon Mount Attacks
| Modifier |  Attack Bonus|
|:------------------|:----------------------:|
| Dexterity               | Creature's DEX modifier + proficiency bonus                |
| Constitution               |  Vehicle's CON modifier + proficiency bonus                |

When creating statistics for a vehicle, it's recommended to use the vehicle's Constitution formula for determining its attack bonus. This makes it easier to standardize the vehicle for challenge rating calculation without having to make assumptions on the statistics of the driver.

## Vehicle List 
The following is a list of vehicles for use by player characters and non-player characters alike. The vehicles in this list are grouped by type and arranged alphabetically. 

Of course, the vehicles presented here are simply those that come standard on a production line. The DM is welcome to create their own vehicle using the guidelines at the beginning of this Appendix, or customize one from the following list. Similarly, with the DM's approval, the players might create their own vehicles that suit their purposes using the same rules.

### Armored Transports 
These vehicles are typically the transport mode of choice for government officials, corporate executives, and other VIPs. The vehicle's cabin and internals, including the undercarriage, are protected by thick armor plating, and the windows are made of tempered bulletproof glass that keep the occupants safe from harm.

### Floatplanes 
The floatplane is a favorite of off-grid explorers, able to take off and land from water where runways don't exist. Buoyant struts affixed under the wings and/or the fuselage keep the plane afloat, and a clear stretch of water is all that is needed for takeoff and landing. While hydrobrakes eliminate the need for a long landing, pilots need to be cautious of touching down on a body of water without sufficient room for takeoff. 

### Helicopters
An incredibly versatile vehicle, the helicopter can be a luxurious way to beat the traffic, a means of transporting cargo or personnel where land vehicles dare not tread, or a dynamic close air support asset. This rotary-wing aircraft has seen it all and done it all. Eliminating the need for a runway entirely, helicopters can access extremely hard to reach environments, and their ability to hover in place lets them stay "on station" in a way not able to be matched by conventional fixed-wing aircraft. Significantly less stable than a plane, however, a helicopter is more difficult to control due to their relative lack of aerodynamic features. When a helicopter wants to fall, it falls; forget about gliding to a happy landing.

___
***Stable Flight.*** The helicopter has a +5 bonus to ability checks and saving throws against effects that would knock it prone.
:
***Explosive Death*** When the vehicle is destroyed, it explodes. Targets within 10 feet of the car must make a DC 14 Dexterity  saving throw. A target takes 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

### Actions
***Autocannon*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, Range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit* 2d10+5 force damage. The autocannon is controlled by the second crew station aboard the helicopter. If only one pilot is present, the autocannon attack cannot be used.   
:
***Rocket pods*** *(Recharge 5-6)* The helicopter launches a barrage of rockets at a point within 240 feet. Each target in a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d6 piercing damage and 5d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. 

### Reactions
***Flares*** When the helicopter is targeted by an attack that it can see, it can impose disadvantage on the attack roll by deploying decoy countermeasures meant to disrupt targeting systems on seeker missiles, but which also act to obscure the helicopter visually.

***Drop-Cable.*** The helicopter's swift insertion system for riders to safely reach the ground. A creature riding the helicopter, or near a lowered cable beneath the helicopter, can use its bonus action to tether itself to a cable. The creature can then use half its movement to ascend or descend up to 100 feet without taking falling damage if it lands.

The cable automatically untethers and retracts itself when the creature lands on a solid or liquid surface, or when it re-enters the helicopter. Otherwise the cable allows the creature to hang below the helicopter until the creature lands or it returns to the helicopter.

### Military Ground Vehicles 
On the one hand, they're built by the lowest bidder, aren't particularly comfortable, and tend to cost a fortune in maintenance. On the other hand, they're armed, armored, and *cool as hell*. These vehicles waste absolutely no effort on civilian sector comforts and emphasize armor, weaponry, and the ability to withstand a bit of mistreatment.

# Appendix C: Social Rules

While the world of D&D features a great many mechanics for exploration and combat, it is often a bit sparse when it comes to social encounters. In some ways, this is intended, as the actual players at the table bring to life the conversations and eccentricities of the characters involved using their own voice, skill, and ill-timed jokes. However, there are still scenarios as it pertains to non-violent character interaction that can be enhanced with additional mechanics. This Appendix contains several optional rules for such interactions. 

## Reputation 

Over the course of play, your reputation will fluctuate as you gather more notoriety and as you leverage it for various advantages. Your reputation can never fall below 0, and there is no limit to how high your reputation can climb.

### Leveraging Your Reputation
Reputation is used to measure your social capital and the influence that you can exert. Similar to objects and services, favors have a Value rating. Anytime you Leverage your Reputation to gain a favor with a Value higher than your current Reputation, your Reputation goes down. How much your Reputation is reduced depends on how valuable the favor is. 

Compare the Value of the favor or item to your current Reputation score and consult the table below to see how much your Reputation will decrease if you choose to go through with the request.

| Value| Reputation Decrease |
|:------------------|:-------------|
| 15 or higher        |  1 point |
| 1-10 points higher than your Reputation        |  1 point  |
| 11-15 points higher than your Reputation       |  1d6 points    |
| 16-20 points higher than your Reputation    |  2d6 points   |
| 20+ points higher than your Reputation         |  Favor unobtainable |

This system is functionally identical to purchasing items using Wealth. You cannot request a favor that is more than 20 points higher than your current Reputation. If your reputation drops to 0, you have exhausted your social capital and cannot request favors or requisition equipment until you have regained some of your Reputation.

### Increasing Your Reputation 
There are a number of ways to build your Reputation. You can spend your downtime rubbing elbows with the elite in your circles. Keep track of the hours you spend networking. When you have accumulated a number of hours equal to your current Reputation score, your Reputation score increases by 1, and you reset your accumulated hours to 0. 

Your reputation can also grow as you go about your daily life. At the end of each month, make a Charisma check. If the result is higher than your current Reputation, your Reputation increases by 1. 

You may also gain Reputation increases when completing missions, objectives, or goals. Guidelines for appropriate rewards are given below.

| Significance of Objective| Reputation Increase |
|:------------------|:-------------|
| Minor       |  1  |
| Major        |  2  |
| Critical       |  4   |

### Calling in Favors
Favors make the world go ‘round, and you’ll probably want to call in your fair share of them. Favors have a Value rating commensurate with the risk they carry for the one granting the favor, and following the rules for Leveraging your Reputation presented above. 

Remember, though, that no matter how much social capital you’ve gathered, the person you ask a favor from can always say no to a particularly dangerous or suicidal request. Similarly, the DM can rule that the Value for a Favor from a particular individual might be reduced owing to the relationship between them and the character requesting the favor.

| Apparent Risk| Value |
|:------------------|:-------------|
| None        |  1 point |
| Slight (Minor social consequences)       |  10+2d4  |
| Moderate (Retribution or Minor legal problems)      |  15+2d4    |
| Extreme (Severe retribution or Major legal problems)    |  20+4d4  |
| Deadly (Threats or attacks on their person, friends, or family)         |  30+8d4 |

### Do I know you?
To determine if one character recognizes another based on their Reputation, roll a d20. If the result is lower than the target's Reputation score, the target is recognized. Certain modifiers may apply to the target's Reputation score for the purposes of being recognized, as described in the following table.
If the character is acquainted with the target, they automatically recognize them without having to make a roll, unless there is a good reason for them not to.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote APPENDIX C | SOCIAL RULES }}
\page

| Situation| Reputation Modifier |
|:------------------|:-------------|
| Character has extensive knowledge of the field(s) making the target renowned       |  +6 |
| Character is fairly involved in the field(s) making the target renowned        |  +4  |
| Character is peripherally involved in the field(s) making the target renowned     |  +2    |
| Character has no connection to the field(s) making the target renowned   |  -2   |

If the target is disguised, usually the character must pass a check to see through the disguise before attempting to recognize the target.

When a player character is recognized, they may gain advantage or disadvantage on certain checks, depending on whether their Reputation puts them in a positive or negative light to the individual recognizing them, as determined by the DM. For example, a character recognized as an infamous criminal would likely gain disadvantage on many social checks involving law enforcement, but may gain advantage on Intimidation checks.

### Social Maneuvering
Sometimes your reputation can save you when your charms fail you. When you fail a Charisma ability check you can leverage your Reputation to reroll the result of the check, using the new result instead. Compare your Reputation score to a Value equal to the DC of the ability check you just failed, and lower your Reputation as described above. To do this, the target of the check must recognize you.

\column

The DM has final say over whether you can use this optioning any given situation. For instance, if you are using Deception to try to convince a target that you are someone you’re not, it would be inappropriate to Leverage your Reputation to succeed.

## Drinking 

A nigh-inevitable element of any D&D game (be there a dwarf in the party or not) is the copious consumption of alcohol. Usually done in off-hours, though it can certainly be funnier if done mid-adventure, the tabletop pub crawl is a common feature of many games. While this can certainly be done purely by description and bad impressions of slurred speech, the following are mechanics to give your fictional imbibement some weight.
### Getting Buzzed
Whenever you have a drink (a shot of whiskey, a glass of wine, a pint of ale), a creature must make a Constitution ability check. The DC is 10 + the number of drinks that they’ve had, -1 for each hour since they’ve started drinking. On a success, nothing happens. On a failure, they gain a level of Buzz as shown in the table below. A creature that rolls 10 below the DC throws up in addition to gaining a level of Buzz.

| Level of Buzz | Effect |
|:------------------|:-------------|
| 1 - Tipsy         |  1d4 Grog Die |
| 2 - Drunk         |  1d6 Grog Die  |
| 3 - Sloshed       |  1D8 Grog Die    |
| 4 - Plastered     |  1D10 Grog Die    |
| 5 - Wasted        |  Unconscious; 1d12 Grog Die |

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote APPENDIX C | SOCIAL RULES }}
\page
When a creature with any levels of Buzz makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, they must roll their Grog Die at the same time. If the Grog Die rolls an odd number, they must subtract it from their roll. If it rolls an even number, they instead add it to the roll. Players are encouraged to roleplay how their drunkenness effected the roll, especially if the Grog Die makes a roll succeed that would’ve otherwise failed, or vice versa.
A creature that spends an hour ingesting food and drink without drinking alcohol loses a level of Buzz. Finishing a long rest also removes all levels of Buzz. When a creature that was Plastered or Wasted becomes sober again, they throw up.
A creature that falls unconscious from drinking stays unconscious for 1d4 hours, at which point they wake up and lose a level of Buzz. A creature that takes damage while unconscious in this way wakes up, but must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw each minute or fall unconscious again until the 1d4 hours have passed.

# Attribution

A tremendous amount of material has been written on the topic of "Modern Dungeons and Dragons". Most of this material is unofficial, written by curious players and DMs in numerous other homebrews. Other elements are referenced from copyrighted, published material such as that in the official Dungeons and Dragons sourcebooks. 

To the best of my ability, I have attempted to cite any and all sources used in the compilation of this document in this section. I am certain this attribution is incomplete and/or imperfect. The nature of taking influence from not much more than a Google search and too much time means that at some point in the chain, I will likely cite those who also borrowed ideas from elsewhere, perhaps with more limited attribution, and on and on it goes. 

In any event, let me simply say that I take credit for vanishingly little in this document. It is created first and foremost for use at my own gaming table, and is not intended for sale nor any other kind of compensation. It is made available solely as a reference document for those like me who may want a starting point for more modern adventures in the Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition system, for reasons already touched upon in the introduction to this book. Please direct your accolades to the individuals listed below, who have put in far more effort and creativity than I.

# Saddle Up, Lock and Load

Have you ever wanted to pilot an Mi-24 Hind attack helicopter into battle against a wyvern? Charge headfirst against the Tanar'ri of the Abyss while wielding a trench shotgun? Or maybe hack into the bank accounts of an ancient red dragon and drain his finances rather than recklessly raid his lair?

Replete with character subclasses, weapons, vehicles, and even rules for managing your credit, this book is designed to integrate modern technology into the fantastic world of Dungeons and Dragons®. 
:
Time marches on. A good adventurer should always be prepared to adapt.
